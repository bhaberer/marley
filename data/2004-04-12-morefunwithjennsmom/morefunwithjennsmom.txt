# More fun with Jenn's Mom

Later on Saturday BoCo and AndyF showed up to hang out. I was in the middle of watching Magnolia and so they sat down and watched it, BoCo is a fan of the movie, but since AndyF hadn't seen it before he was frightened and confused. :)

While Andy read through my veggie cookbooks and BoCo set about figuring out how to TimeAttack Zelda better, I set about making some pasta for dinner. I made a yummy pasta with Penne, and a roasted garlic sauce with broccoli and mushrooms.

After a while I said goodbye to the guys and headed over to [[Jenn]]'s to hang out with her and her mother. Good Times. We watched [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325805/ Matchstick Men] which was pretty cool.

Sunday i spent most of my day at work walking around the MachineRoom taking cabinet inventory. I'm working on making it easier for the operators to find any giving machine in the machine room. Right now we just kind of have to look for things. Since some departments like the NOC aren't real big on registering machines with us. Bastards.

I got to have brunch with [[Jenn]] and her Mother at the Scholar's Inn.  I've heard good things about the place, but it seemed either running at capacity because of the Easter holiday, or entirely too overrated. 

Later in the Afternoon KirstenHaberer came by work with an Easter basket full of goodies from MoM and JanS. :) Yay for candy that will make me in even worse shape than I already am. I really need to go get my bike and either sell/give it to someone and get a new one I think. A new Trek with shocks and trigger shifting sounds nice... I would like to be able to bike to work this summer.

In the evening I went over and visited with Jenn and her Mom for a while. [[Jenn]] made me some Banana Bread :) it's soooo yummy. Thanks Jenn. We hung out for a while and then [[Jenn]] and I went and got Virginia, a friend of [[Jenn]]'s from work. We all went over to Bears for Simpsons fun.

A very fun weekend, It was nice to meet Jenn's mom... oh! and Jenn's mom took some pictures of us. See: BrianandJenn.

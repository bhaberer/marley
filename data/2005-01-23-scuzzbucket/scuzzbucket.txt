Scuzzbucket!
The other night Katie and Virginia came over and we all watched [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091059/ Flight of the Navigator] which [[Jenn]] got me as a gift, cause she's awesome. :) We had a lot of fun hanging out, Dan didn't show up cause he's a punk who doesn't like classic movies!  {nid 1L5}

I was going to get my bike on Saturday, but it started snowing. So that's been delayed until hopefully tomorrow. I'm getting really anxious to go test ride my new trek. :) It's so happy and shiny! {nid 1L6}

Paul is here for the weekend, so that's cool. We went out for dinner and drinks last night with a lot of the hackers and some people from work. It was good times.  {nid 1L7}

Not sure if anything else is going on today, working for now... lots of fun.  {nid 1L8}

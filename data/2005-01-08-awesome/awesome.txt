# Just an update.

I know I'm bad about journaling these days, a lot of it stems for the amount of WoW I play, and a lot stems from the fact that I don't have much to say that I feel has any worth, but the most compelling reason has been that I'm always tired when I'm at work, and that's when I normally updated it in the past.  {nid 1KD}

However that will be changing for a while I hope, since as of Monday morning I'm back on day shift for the moment at least. The guy who bumped me back in April of last year is going on extended (12 weeks) leave on FMLA for some odd reason and so I'm moving to days to cover for him. I don't know what's going to happen when/if he comes back, but we'll see. I'm going to enjoy being on day shift for these three months at least! :) {nid 1KE}

I'm still looking at bikes, and waiting for the weather to clear for a few days so that the Bike place will let me take a couple out for a spin. I'm leaning towards the 6500 with disc breaks, but I don't know for sure yet.  {nid 1KF}

I still plan on making my "New Years Post" but I'm having writers block at the moment, hopefully I'll have it up in the next few days tho. (if you don't know what I'm talking about, check out [http://www.livejournal.com/users/weirdo513/221352.html this LJ post of mine]. {nid 1KG}

I'm going to head down to Evansville for the weekend now, I'm going to help my Mom clean up the house and get some random stuff done like furniture moving. I'm also taking Jenn to Steven Libbs to get some chocolate to binge on, it's going to be great. I like taking trips with Jenn, it's always great fun... I love her so much. :) {nid 1KH}

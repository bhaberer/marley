# Another Week in the Books

Today was nice, I went home from work and fell asleep. After a few hours, [[Jenn]] came over and woke me up, she had gone running and done laundry while I had been sleeping. She left for a while to go do some shopping, and I went back to sleep for another hour.

When Jenn came back, and I finally got up. We wandered back over to her place so that she could get dressed for climbing. I put on the Al Frankin Audio Book, since Jenn is a fan. We headed down to the climbing gym only to find it packed to the brim with people and kids, so we passed on climbing for today.

We headed home and stopped on the way to grab "[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310793/ Bowling for Columbine]" which I have not seen. We also did some shopping and headed home.

We decided to pass on Bears since we had food and since no one had voiced a desire to come. So we made some faux breaded chicken burgers. Which actually taste pretty much identical. I guess it's not to hard to replicate the taste of a patty normally consisting of "Mechanically Separated Chicken" which is a term that gets me drooling, let me tell you.

After dinner we sat down to watch Simpsons, and then the first half of Bowling for Columbine. Which is very interesting so far... The bank that gave you a free gun with a new account was kind of disturbing, but *shrug* I'm pretty weirded out about giving away shotguns to random people. :)

I also got to look through Jenn's photos and now I have a couple cute pictures of her that are real and not just on-line pictures. They are cute, and one is in my cube now. :) Only an hour to go... then sleep.

I think I'm going to meet Jenn for lunch today which will be nice. Hope everyone is doing well.

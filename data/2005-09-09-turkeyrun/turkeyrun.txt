Turkey Run, and more. 

So a couple weeks ago [[Jenn]] and I went up to [http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A//www.turkeyrunstatepark.com/&ei=KrAhQ8aVIq2GavreoZoD Turkey Run State Park]. It was a lot of fun, we stayed there for several days. On the first day we traversed the [http://www.weirdo513.org/tr5.jpg suspension bridge] took a [http://www.weirdo513.org/tr1.jpg hike through a canyon], it was so beautiful, the walls of the canyon went over our heads and [http://www.weirdo513.org/tr2.jpg trees were growing on the edges]. The trail continued up along a [http://www.weirdo513.org/tr4.jpg stream bed] which was so beautiful. The whole park is so beautiful, [http://www.weirdo513.org/tr3.jpg lots of cool rock formations]. We also went horseback riding, but it was more like horseback following... :) {nid 1YH}

The second day we went canoeing, which was a bad idea. The creek was "a little low" according to the canoe people... which was canoe people code for "you're going to have to drag that 100lb canoe for like 10-20% of the distance. Which was unfun.  {nid 1YI}

I just got a new 300gb hard drive and a new case. I replaced my old [http://weirdo513.org/gallery/shiva/aad PC-60] with an updated version of the same case ([http://www.anandtech.com/casecooling/showdoc.aspx?i=2357 Reviewed over at Anandtech]) I did a decent job on the [http://weirdo513.org/gallery/shiva/aak inside] I think I'm going to get a window panel and some more blue lighting, for kicks. I really like SATA drives so far, and I'm actually contemplating buying another 300gb drive soonish.  {nid 1YJ}

On completely different topic, I'm downloading some Kenshin and Bleach episodes right now. I've been missing anime but I did not have the energy to actually go out and find some on my own. Kenshin is described in it's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rurouni_Kenshin entry in wikipedia], it's very enjoyable, and the Kenshin OAV is one of the more mature Anime movies I've seen. [http://www.anime-source.com/banzai/modules.php?name=Reviews&rop=showcontent&id=993 Bleach] is an Anime I just started getting yesterday and I'm enjoying it so far... It smacks of a very mature version of another anime I have, called 'Flame of Recca'.  {nid 1YK}

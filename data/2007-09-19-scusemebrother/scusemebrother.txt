# Can you spare a swipe?

Thoughts on how the digital age has affected those without means. 

I wonder what the impact of the debit card has been on the average American bum.

I mean, once upon a time people carried cash with them.

Even I was known to dig deep and help those guys out. However, recently Iâ€™ve noticed that I never carry cash anymore. I always feel bad when I have to offer up what sounds like a lie, but I really do not have one cent in cash on me. I use my debit card for everything.

Maybe in the future they will issue beggars some sort of debit card swipe device. That would be kind of interesting.

Ah, random 5:47am thoughts. Where would my lack of sanity be without you?

# San Diego - Day 2

The next morning we got up and headed to the comic-con.

The next morning we got up and headed to the comic-con. We decided to drive to the El Cajun station and ride the trolley in from there. The trolley ride was cool, albeit a tad on the slow side. We finally got to the convention center and found the line for registration. On the way in we spotted a family dressed up in full Klingon battle gear. We got registered and headed down to the main floor.

First thing we saw was [http://kurtz.buzznet.com/user/?id=402844 Scott Kurtz at the PvP booth]. I got a copy of the new PvP comic, and the Dork Years compilation. Scott was nice enough to sign them and we were off on our way. We met the [http://www.machall.com/ MacHall] guys who seemed really cool. And we stopped by the [http://www.goats.com Goats] guys and got some stickers and made some chit chat.

The whole time we were surrounded on all side with all manor of people in costumes. Some of note was an Kenobi guy on his cell phone which struck me as funny for some reason, a group of people cosplaying the characters from Samurai Showdown, A few storm troopers, a group of guys in full plate mail and more.

We headed on over to the [http://www.penny-arcade.com Penny-Arcade] booth to say hi to Tycho and Gabe. the crowd was unusually thin so we took a few minutes to talk with Tycho as Gabe sat back and doodled. [[Jenn]] started giving Tycho shit for his substandard poster rolling technique. He's a slacker. Gabe was nice enough to DoodleOnmyPoster and Tycho signed it.

After we saw them we headed over to the [http://www.megatokyo.com Megatokyo] booth. Sarah and Fred were busy as hell but Fred was able to DoodleMeAPiro which was awesome. We wandered around a bit more and I snagged some free Manga, which is interesting and strange. We also stopped by the [http://www.reallifecomics.com Real Life] booth and talked with Greg for a bit... he's is shockingly similar to his on-line self in appearance. He was very cool and while I was there the creator of City of Heroes came up and started chatting with him. That was a trip. I got him to print me out a copy of today's strip and sign it.

I had a lot of fun, I wish I had more time but I know [[Jenn]] was at her wits end with all the noise and people so we made a hasty exit stopping by the [http://www.little-gamers.com Little Gamers] booth to say hi, and bitch about my lack of cash... I wanted to get one of their little con books. :( I would like to come back another time, maybe organise something next year... but who knows.

We headed home and it was nice to be away from the droves of dorks :) We rode the trolley home, and stopped for smoothies along the way... yummy smoothies. Jamba Juice is teh win! :) We went back to the house and took a nap while they made supper. Loni made this Veggie thing that was like a veggie lasagna with no noodles or meat... which was weird, but surprisingly good. We're going to try and get the recipe so we can make it again. [[Jenn]]'s Dad opened a bottle of the Oliver Wine I brought him (a three pack with a bottle of Muscat Caneli, Beanblossom Blush and Gewurztramine) and we had a nice meal.

After dinner [[Jenn]] and I walked their dog and had a nice long chat. It was a beautiful twilight walk and the weather here is insanely nice right now.

We decided to go hit an Irish Pub for a little time out on the town. It was nice, Jenn got some chocolate cake, and I had some Black Thorn Draft Cider that they had on tap. GoodTimes! :)

We headed home and went to sleep to prepare for the next day.

# One of my new favorite shows.

I downloaded the first few episodes of the show [http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/30days/main.html 30 Days]. It's a show done by Morgan Spurlock, the guy who did [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/ Super Size Me]. 

I downloaded the first few episodes of the show [http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/30days/main.html 30 Days]. It's a show done by Morgan Spurlock, the guy who did [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/ Super Size Me]. The basic premise is that people engage in abnormal behavior for 30 days, it feels kind of like a reality show with a hippy twist. {nid 21P}

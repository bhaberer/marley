# Paul and stuff.

Quick entry before I pass out, please pardon the simple sentences and typos as I'm very tired. {nid 23E}

Oh! A quick note, I aced my Logic test. I even almost broke the curve. Go me.  {nid 23F}

In other interesting news, Paul came to visit this past weekend. It was good times.  {nid 23G}

:But before I talk about that... let me explain this thing I'm going to start doing. I'm going to start dumping all the random pictures I take with my camera on my phone (weather I use them in a blog post or not) in the following folder in my gallery: http://weirdo513.org/gallery/phoneimgblog  {nid 23H}

:These pictures will not be edited in any way, and will not be of great quality. But they will be around for the purposes of me being able to blog with photos and not feel pressure to make them look like I'm a real photographer. I hope to one day go back to doing real photography... but not now.  {nid 23I}

On to the relevant portion of this spewing, I met up with the group at Soma on Saturday, and then we headed over to Joe's place to hang out and chat and play with teh Tango. {nid 23J}

After hanging out for a while, Paul, Brett, Troy, Rebbecca, and myself headed out for dinner at Bombay House. While we were there, [[Jenn]] showed up and joined in on the fun. After dinner we wandered over to The Irish Lion and had some drinks, we also (and by we I mean everyone except Jenn who was quite horrified) made silverware sculptures.  {nid 23N}

Fun times. It was nice seeing Troy and Paul again.  {nid 23P}

Other random things that are cool: {nid 23Q}

* The French guild "Empire" put out a series of Blackwing Lair videos that are just fucking amazingly well done. You can get them here: [http://files.filefront.com/BWL_Episode_1rar/;4176913;;/fileinfo.html Part 1], [http://files.filefront.com/BWL_Episode_2rar/;4312633;;/fileinfo.html Part 2], and [http://files.filefront.com/BWL_Episode_3rar/;4789872;;/fileinfo.html Part 3]. Well worth the download in my opinion! {nid 23R}
* I've devised a half-assed RecipeForFishballSoup. I make it about 2-3 times a week it's not quite as good as Noodletown's soups, but it's a nice cheap substitute. {nid 23S}
* I've taken to snagging a copy of the IDS and solving the entire crossword (it's not a very hard one) and the sudoku puzzles. I find I enjoy sudoku, which I find surprising as it looked really fucking annoying till I tried it.  {nid 23T}
* I recently got a DVD burner, and it makes me happy.  {nid 23U}

I'll post a more useful entry at another time, I swear!

# Rails3 Upgrade notes (2010/09/15)

Just a few notes on some stupid issues I encountered upgrading Brewtopian to Rails3.

First off, big thanks to [Ryan Bates](http://workingwithrails.com/person/6491-ryan-bates) and his [Railscasts on upgrading to Rails3](http://railscasts.com/episodes/225-upgrading-to-rails-3-part-1). They were extremely helpful with the overall process. 

### No method <method_name> for <model>:Module, or Why is my Class a Module now?

So, the shift to Rails3 made one kind of transparent, but important change. In the past when you spun up a new rails app, nothing that important could collide with the name of your app. In fact, as far as I know (and I can certainly be wrong here) the name of the app didn't really matter all that much.

However, now that name is used in a great many places, on a new app you'll see it no less than 12-15 times.

    ~ > rails new therails
          create
          create  README
          create  Rakefile
    [ .. ]
    ~ > grep -R Therails therails/
    therails/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:  <title>Therails</title>
    therails/config.ru:run Therails::Application
    therails/config/environment.rb:Therails::Application.initialize!
    therails/config/environments/test.rb:Therails::Application.configure do
    therails/config/environments/development.rb:Therails::Application.configure do
    therails/config/environments/production.rb:Therails::Application.configure do
    therails/config/application.rb:module Therails
    therails/config/routes.rb:Therails::Application.routes.draw do
    therails/config/initializers/secret_token.rb : Therails::Application.config.secret_token = [...]
    therails/config/initializers/session_store.rb : Therails::Application.config.session_store :cookie_store, :key => '_therails_session'
    therails/config/initializers/session_store.rb:# Therails::Application.config.session_store :active_record_store
    therails/Rakefile:Therails::Application.load_tasks

This is all fine and good if you had your app name picked out ahead of time and used something distinctive. However, when I was prototyping [Brewtopian](http://brewtopian.com/) I did not have a name, and used a generic name of 'beer' for the app. Fast-forward to my rails3 upgrade, and I now have 'module Beer' at the top of my application.rb file as part of the rails3 upgrade. This causes problems because this generic name is the same as a class, Beer, which I had used in my app. 

If you hit this issue, you will need to rename your app, and search and replace all the files I mentioned above for any references to the old name. 

## OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: hostname was not match with the server certificate

Another annoying issue (which might be limited to Mediatemple, my DNS/mail host) was that my Mail stopped working. 

Under 2.3.8 I was using this in my environment.rb

    ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :smtp
    
    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
       :address => "mail.server.com",
       :port => 25,
       :domain => "server.com",
       :authentication => :login,
       :user_name => "user@server.com",
       :password => "password",
    }

Under 3.0.0, this was no longer working. I moved the config to 'config/initializers/setup_mail.rb'. This didn't help much as I was still getting some odd errors and connection rejections. I finally tried switching to port 587, but that didn't help things, I just got another error relating to the cert. I my googling I came across the solution, seems that the app was trying to use TLS, so I added a directive to disable that, and everything worked. 

    ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :smtp
    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
      :address => "mail.server.com",
      :port => 587,
      :domain => "server.com",
      :authentication => :login,
      :user_name => "user@server.com",
      :password => "password",
      :enable_starttls_auto => false
    }

# R.I.P. Misty.

I took [[Misty]] (my '94 Honda Civic) to Honda the other day to have it looked at and the head gasket is blown... which is going to be close to $1000 to get fixed and taken care of when all is said and done. But, with the power steering rack leaking, the alignment fucked, the back door handle not working, and the power windows making unhappy sounds.... it's time for a new car. :(

I found a nice happy silver 1997 Honda Civic LX. (Pictures: [http://weirdo513.org/civic/civic1.jpg Front] [http://weirdo513.org/civic/civic2.jpg Back] [http://weirdo513.org/civic/civic3.jpg Inside]) If all goes according to plans I'll have a new car tomorrow... it's amazing how fast things can change when you need them to...

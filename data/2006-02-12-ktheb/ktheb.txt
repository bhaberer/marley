So for those who care. I'm going to ramble on a bit about my guild crap in Warcraft.  My guild just defeated the last bit of content in the current game. We beat the last boss in 'Blackwing Lair'. It's a big achievement, and it took a lot of teamwork to get it beaten. I'm pretty stoked. {nid 22W}

We're done with anything new for a few weeks, when the next hard area opens. I'm looking forward to it, it looks so cool. {nid 22X}

::The most disappointing movie of the year ever. It was a good movie... but I don't know... I just couldn't get into it at all. The individual performances of Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman were outstanding, but I guess I just don't care about boxing enough or something. {nid 230}

:: One of the best movies I've seen in a while. Usually I watch movies while I'm working, or gaming. But I found myself immersed in this movie about two Japanese high school ping pong students. I know it sounds like a weird premise for a movie, but the movie was amazing. I have a copy so if anyone wants to see it let me know. {nid 233}

::This movie was amazingly well done. Very Very gory... I would warn about that. I enjoyed this movie a lot, even if some of the political messages I don't particularly agree with. {nid 236}

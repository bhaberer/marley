# Not Much...

Going on in the personal life, I'm still waiting for my transition to day shifts, which should be happening soon. Please dear god. Had some fun with TimCarper and DanCarper last night, we went over to bears to watch Simpsons. Good times.

I think TimCarper and I are going to the Blue Bird for their Mardi Gras thing on Tuesday. So, we'll see how that goes. I can't wait till I have somewhat more normal hours and I can go out and play more often.

# Hello World

Not a lot to report, but I'll babble on a bit anyway and make it seem like I have a life :)

The fourth of July was a lot of fun [[Jenn]], BrettSmith, and I had a small get together, JoeandAnami came and we made food and sat around and talked for a while. It was GoodTimes. After dinner, which consisted of Veggie Chic'n patties, corn, and chips and dip, [[Jenn]] wanted to go see the fireworks show, my vote to pass on the show and do one of our own here was overruled. :) No one else wanted to go so we made our way to the Alumni Building on 17th to watch the show. The show was pretty cool, but it started to down pour halfway through, so we had to run for it as they fired off all that they had before the rain ruined it. It was actually a lot of fun :)

Looks like I'll be taking the last part of my UITS Unix EdCert right before I go on vacation.  That will be nice... Go to classes for a week, cert my certification, go sleep, and then wake up and fly to Cali. Sounds good.  I didn't notice till now that the weekend Jenn picked to head to San Diego, happens to be the weekend of the [http://www.comic-con.org/ San Diego Comic Con] which is one of the biggest conventions in the world. So I'm going to see if I can't sneak away to that for a few hours while she's at the beach or something.... maybe that will happen... or not. :)

I've been playing video games a bit more recently. I actually threw in Black and White while ago and I'm teaching my peasants to fear me... good times. I have Warcraft III installed at work to pass the time, I'm halfway through the undead campaign on hard, yea I know you don't care. I also have deleted my old SWG character and made a new one, so that's been interesting.

Last night [[Jenn]] and I went and checked out BethMolnar's work at the Gallery West. People should go and buy her artwork... it's neat.  After we went to the show we tracked down Matthew and Beth and went over to Bears for a drink. It was good times.

That's all for now :)

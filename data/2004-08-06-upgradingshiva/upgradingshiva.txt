# Upgrades, and other Tomfoolery.

Worth mentioning that [[Jenn]] and I have been together for five months now. Not a big deal to those of you that have been married for $BIGNUM years but still... yay :) 

[[Jenn]]'s mom came up this week and helped Jenn work on decorating the new condo. It's looking pretty cool. Yesterday my Mom came up to meet Jenn's Mom and we all had dinner at Malibu Grill. It was good times.

Today I'll not be on-line, checking email, or anything else for several hours because my parts order for [[shiva]] should be arriving any minute now. I'm upgrading Shiva from a AMD XP 1700+ to an AMD-64 3000+ So that process will take a few hours. I still need to go grab some stuff (screwdriver (my good one vanished), can of compressed air, etc).

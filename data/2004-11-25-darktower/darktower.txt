# The Dark Tower, WoW, and Thanksgiving.

WoW launched on Tuesday, and despite a large number of technical problems, it seems to be a hit :) I'm playing on the Central PvP server named "Stormreaver" if you feel like tracking my Night Elf Druid, Asmeroth, down. I've started a guild with a few friends, and you can find our site here: http://www.wowguild.net/forums {nid 1JC}

I finally finished the Dark Tower series, the ending was... intense... and while it's not a crow pleasing ending I feel the King was correct, that it's the right ending. I won't say anything else, save for that I loved the Dark Tower series and recommend it highly.  {nid 1JD}

I'm heading out now to drive down to Evansville to have Thanksgiving with the family. [[Jenn]]'s driving, since I just got off a night shift that I had to work alone. SO I'll end here, hope everyone has a wonderful Thanksgiving. {nid 1JE}

# San Diego - Day 1

Well I'm in San Diego, I got in around 10am PST after being up since 1am PST.

Well I'm in San Diego, I got in around 10am PST after being up since 1am PST. I met [[Jenn]] at the airport and gave her a big hug, grabbed my bag from baggage claim and headed out. We had planned on skipping the [http://www.comic-con.org San Diego Comic-Con] all together but she had decided we should go after all, and so we drove by to scope out the lines. On the way there we saw the [http://www.thesandiegochannel.com/news/3561760/detail.html USS Ronald Regan] docked in the harbor which was pretty cool looking. We drove down past the comic-con and saw that it was pretty packed so we vetoed it for the day and headed home to Jenn's parent's place in [http://www.city-data.com/city/Rancho-San-Diego-California.html Rancho San Diego].

On the way home we dropped by [http://www.in-n-out.com/ In-and-Out burger] for lunch. It was pretty dammed good. They make everything there (even the buns) fresh every day so they have a dammed good burger... and the fries were great.

We then headed home and hung out for a while, I worked on her Dad's computer because it had gotten loaded down with spy-ware. I removed the spy-ware (350 items in Ad-Aware, a new record), and removed a lot of other stuff and finally installed Norton for good measure. We also went and visited [http://www.ikea.com IKEA]. It was very cool... so many neat things I can't in the least afford. :)

I got to meet Jenn's Dad for the first time for dinner where we went to a wonderful Mexican place called [http://www.entersandiego.com/restaurants/restaurant.cfm?res_id=77 Casa de Bendini] down in [http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=663 Old Town San Diego]. It was very yummy. [Jenn]'s Dad seems pretty cool, he reminds me a lot of my Dad on a lot of levels tho.

After that [[Jenn]] and I went up to [http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2810721-mount_soledad_la_jolla-i Mount Soledad] and looked out over the San Diego landscape, it was very beautiful. After getting lost in the La Jolla area for a while we went home to goto sleep.

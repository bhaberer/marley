# Happy Birthday Jenn!

First off, it's [[Jenn]]'s birthday. She's 23, I'm going to shower her with good vibrations and love as much as possible today.

First off, it's [[Jenn]]'s birthday. She's 23, I'm going to shower her with good vibrations and love as much as possible today. :) In a few days it will be our 6th month anniversary, and I can't recall a relationship that's been as fulfilling as this has been. This weekend we're going up to Indy on Friday night and staying at the Hyatt and having a night on the town, between now and then there will be picnic at Oliver Winery. And other such romantic niceties. :) [[Jenn]] makes me incredibly happy and a lot of the time I don't think I much deserve a woman so wonderful. 

On to things that don't make the greater part of my audience gag... :) 

On World of Warcraft: [http://www.fileplanet.com/betacenter/wow/upsells/imgs/closedpic.jpg The fact that the WoW Stress Test] is already closed... is lame. I'm reading more about this game and I'm convinced that if Blizzard does this they could steal a dramatic chunk of market share and leave FFXI, SWG and EQ2 to fight for the scraps. I feel like I'm the only one in the world not in the damn beta. *paces* 

Speaking of SWG, I'm going to try the Jedi stuff they just put in I guess... Sounds fun.

My verdict on Saga of Ryzom is that it needs lots of work. It's frustrating and cumbersome interface really annoys me and I'm a bit of a UI Nazi. And the fact that there is no consider system yet, and all the newbie enemies look the same... gets very very annoying after you die for the 80th time. And the server the open beta is on seems to be in some European country known for it's hard-to-pronounce alcohol names and high ping times.

I think I'm now in full job seeking status. I'm not seeing any real movement on getting my job back and I can't keep doing this third shift stuff. I'm also debating possibly going back to school next year and finishing off my last two years. But this is all up in the air. [http://www.machall.com/index.php?do_command=show_strip&strip_id=295&auth=01101-10010-01010-10101-11111 This] is kind of my current situation... which amuses me.

The students are back in full force. As is evident by my getting flipped off by people who cut me off. God I hate those stupid bastards. I'm sure I'm having [http://www.machall.com/index.php?do_command=show_strip&strip_id=294&auth=01101-10010-01010-10101-11111 Freshman selective memory] a little bit, but my [http://www.machall.com/index.php?do_command=show_strip&strip_id=5&auth=01101-10010-01010-10101-11111 dorm] [http://www.machall.com/index.php?strip_id=6 experiences] (both the instances in those comics have happened to me *shudder*) were a little more on the geek side and not so much on the drunken retard frat boy side. But, whatever.

I'm probably going to order the [http://store.yahoo.com/jsbstash/clx10andvdsi.html Clerks: Tenth Anniversary] DVD set.  Wandering around that site is cool, they have lots of random movie stuff. I saw that they have [http://www.abbyshot.com/products/ps-silent-bob.php a certain coat] and it would be nice to replace the trusty ol' Navy coat I have, which is starting to fall apart. I'm sure [[Jenn]] would kill me and burn my body if I got that tho. :) I would like another nice long coat tho, I'm not a big fan of jackets.

I'm not thrilled with the [http://www.viewaskew.com/news/aug04/3.html news about the sequel to clerks] coming out [http://viewaskew.com/theboard/viewtopic.php?t=14125 Kevin has some words] which are a bit reassuring but I'm wary. To use his words, I really don't want Jay and Silent Bob to be the next "Paulie Shore".

I got the [http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/zeldafourswords/index.html The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures] for game cube, and Brett and I have been playing that, I was hoping to track BoCo down but I can't seem to... damn college kids!

Oh yea, I suck at reading Live-journal... like I have so many stupid journals and communities and friends I can't even remember how they got on my list... but regardless I'm going to try using the power of friend's lists to regain the ability to read my friends page with some speed and not feel like a horrible person nearly as often :)

I think that's it for now.

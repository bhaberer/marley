# Back to the grind of third shift.

Well yesterday I started back on third shift. I came in and BobCollins informed me that another third shifter had quit, and so I was on my own for the evening. Which was great since I'm a) still adjusting to completely flipping my sleep schedule and b) sick. {nid QL}

One of the side problems of Ray quitting out of the blue is that my supervisor wants me to work on Friday nights now, but that's not going to happen at the moment, since my next three weekends are booked... which is a weird thing to realize out of the blue. :) Next weekend [[Jenn]] and I are heading down to Evansville after we get her new condo inspected.  I'm not sure what we're going to do there, but I hope to have lunch with [[Mom]] (I'll stop using MoM since people whine about it for some reason.) and JanS. And then we'll probably spend a few hours wandering around town, and maybe hit Pasta Grill before we head back... mmm... pasta grill. {nid QM}

The Friday after that we are going to a work party with [[Jenn]]'s coworkers. Which should be lots of fun if mildly socially awkward :) {nid QN}

Then, the following weekend is a trip to Cincy, for my birthday present from [[Jenn]]. Which was tickets to an Ani DiFranco concert. Which is very cool, I'm excited to see her in concert again. Since the concert get out at 12amish we are going to try and stay with PaulVisscher for that evening and hopefully hang out with him, JasonCook and maybe Sara (Jason's [[SO]]). {nid QO}

And then actually the following week is my birthday, what a month! {nid QP}

But anyway, last night wasn't that bad overall, pretty quiet. I got a chance to work on my InventoryManagementSystem stuff and got some more of the work done, I have the Edit and display scripts pretty much done for now. I'm working on the Single Server Display and the add/remove widgets now. Oh and big thanks to BrettSmith, JasonCook and PaulVisscher for the random help they have been giving. {nid QQ}

This morning after my first work shift my boss Toma let me go a little early cause I was feeling awful, I started to head home and noticed a small envelope under my wiper, I pulled over and grabbed it to find that [[Jenn]] had left me a sweet note :) it cheered me up and put me in a much better mood. {nid QR}

I went home and put some towels over my window (which work much better than the old sleeping bag I used to use) and took a few hour nap. I got up around 12:00 to go have lunch with [[Jenn]] at Lennie's. That was nice. {nid QS}

I'm back at work... kinda bored... I should go and start reading this Steinbeck novel [[Jenn]] has lent me. It looks interesting. I'm making her read a DouglasAdams book called "Last chance to See" which is a nice easy read, but his fun writing style makes it a wonderful book [[imho]]. {nid QT}

(oh yea, and people asked to see MyWatch.) {nid RE}

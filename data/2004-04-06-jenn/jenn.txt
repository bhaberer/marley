We've been dating for about a month. She's a beautiful and intelligent person. She moved here from San Diego, California after graduating from [http://www.pomona.edu/ Pomona] with a Psychology major and a Math minor. She works as a lab coordinator in the psych department and will be going here for grad school next year. She's pretty awesome.

And to top it all off, she puts up with me. ;)

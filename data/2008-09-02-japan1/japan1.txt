# Japan, Day 1-3    

I've been back from Japan for a little less than a week, and it's about time to start writing down all the stuff we saw and did on our trip.


Day 1
=====

The first day of any trip is always traveling.

I got to the airport in the wee hours of the morning to catch my 7am flight to Atlanta, where I would be meeting up with my traveling companion, Brett. We got out on the runway, and then sat for about an hour and a half (I only had an hour and 45 in Atlanta to make it to my next flight) while we waited for the rain to stop in Atlanta. We finally took off, and landed in Atlanta with about 15 minutes for me to get to the other side of the airport. As I ran full speed across the airport and boarded the inter-concourse train, I called Brett to give a status update. They were forcing him to either board without me or give up his seat, so he had to board. I rolled up the gate and breathlessly hand them my passport and board the plane just in time. I wandered down and greeted a fairly freaked out Brett.

However, aside from that, the 13 hour flight was actually not too bad. Delta's been shocking me with continually excellent flight experiences. Decent free food, free movies on private LCDs, free sleep masks, etc.

We landed at Narita and proceeded through customs with no issues. Then we exchanged money and got our <a href="http://www.japanrailpass.net/">JR Passes</a>. We got on the Narita Express and headed to Ikebukuro, where our ryokan was.

It took us a while to find the place once we got off the train, due to the fact that it was tucked in a back alley, and the front kind of looked like a back entrance. But, after wandering around the building about five times we decided that the 'back door' was actually the front door.

We relaxed at <a href="http://www.kimi-ryokan.jp/">Kimi Ryokan</a> for a while before we headed out to investigate the neighborhood for some dinner.

After wandering around for a while we settled on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt_sushi">kaiten-zushi</a> place on the nearby strip. I was initially leery of the conveyor places, but this one was sufficiently small, busy and friendly enough that we gave it a try. I'm very glad we did as the sushi was amazing, the people were wonderfully friendly, and we had a great time.

One thing that some people might not realize is that nigirizushi normally comes with wasabi placed between the fish and rice, but a lot (i.e. all) of the places I've been here in Bloomington/America forgo the wasabi. It was initially a shock to find wasabi in everything, but that soon turned into a lust for it in everything when I got home. I've not had a chance to corner Bruce (the main itamae at Sushi Bar) yet and harass him to do so, yet.

After we had our fill we headed out and wandered around the neighborhood a while before heading back to Kimi. </p>

Day 2
=====

We got up bright and early on the second day of our trip, because we had tickets to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghibli_Museum">The Ghibli Museum</a>. We headed over to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitaka">Mitaka</a> and hiked down the road to the museum.

<a class="flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/weirdo513/2809819474/" title="Getting Closer by weirdo513, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3244/2809819474_e59a476033.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="Getting Closer" /></a>

The museum doesn't allow photography, so I'll just have to describe a few of the cooler exhibits.


* There was a series of interconnected rooms plastered with sketches and concept art. As we progressed through the rooms we were walked through all the various steps of producing an animated film.
* There was a room where kids could climb and play with a giant stuffed cat bus.
* There was a room with explanations about how animation works, including a massive Tototro exhibit with tons of small figurines in various stages of an animated scene. It would periodically spin up and animate. It was really a lot cooler than I can explain.


Exploring the museum was a lot of fun in and of itself. Oh, here's a bunch of picture's and explanations on this <a href="http://www.ghibliworld.com/museumspecial.html">Museum Article</a>.

After the museum we headed back to Kimi for a while, before heading to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harajuku">Harajuku</a> to get dinner at a neat little microbiotic place that Brett knew about. It was quite good, but after we ate and wandered around the district a bit, we headed home where we quickly got slammed by jet lag and fell asleep sometime around 7pm.

Day 3
=====

This day started early with a trip for breakfast, and then we heading on to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara">Akihabara</a>.

<a class="flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/weirdo513/2810424272/" title="Sega arcade. by weirdo513, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3171/2810424272_95e31dbbde.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Sega arcade." /></a>

Akihabara, or electric town, is essentially geek paradise. The streets are lined with stores selling everything from light bulbs to wiring. The side streets are clogged with electronics stores, figurine stores, video game stores, manga, anime, soundtracks&#8230; it was amazing. Also, almost everywhere we looked we were beset by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gashapon">Gashapon Machines</a> containing everything from pokemon stickers to half naked figurines of women in bondage (don't ask).

We made a stop by Super Potato first to satisfy our retro gaming desires. SP is a great little retro store in Akiba, with wall to wall games, music, and random retro swag. We wandered around the place for what felt like hours. There is so much there that it kind of overloaded my brain and I just sort of sat there trying to figure out a way I could afford it all.

After Super Potato we headed down the strip to &#8220;HEY Arcade&#8221;, a five story arcade bustling with excellent games and skilled gamers. We took some time to play some games, but we didn&#8217;t stay too long because we had lots to see. We came back later a few times and saw some expert playing.

We ended our trip with a stop by Yodabashi Camera one of the most gigantic electronic stores I've ever seen. They have two entire aisles of capsule machines! We spent an hour or two wandering around, before having lunch in their food court. Yes, this electronics store has a food court. Yes, that's insane.

Before we left, Brett and I both opted to get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moero!_Nekketsu_Rhythm_Damashii_Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan_2">Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2</a>.

After we got done at Yodabashi, we noticed it was raining, so we took the chance to quickly head back to Super Potato, where Brett bought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_Silvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a>. After that we headed back to the Ryokan for a bit while we waited for a friend of Brett's coworkers to meet us for dinner.

When we met up with the friend, we figured out a nearby vegetarian restaurant and headed out for some dinner.  The place was a Tofu place in the Tobu department store, which is one of the largest department stores in the world.  Once we found the place, we sat down and our host ordered up a meal. Everything on the menu was tofu, and it was a bit of overkill for a simple omnivore like myself. However I enjoyed the food and the company. We headed back to the hotel by way of the Tobu market, stopping to grab a couple riceballs.

Once we made it back to the hotel, we spent some time on the internet before another jet lag induced crash.

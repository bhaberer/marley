# Small Update, Big News.

I'll be posting a big entry with lots of pictures once I get back from California. But my access is sketchy so I'm gonna wait till I can upload without fear.

But I mainly wanted to post this quick note for Jenn.

Happy Anniversary Jenn. It's been an amazing year. And, while things have not always gone as smoothly as they seem to in those movies you like to make me watch, I wouldn't have given up the last twelve months with you for anything. I love you so much.

Here's to a lifetime of cleaning up cat puke, cleaning out soda cans, listening to you tell me how to drive, listening to me tell you how to live, your neurotic compulsion to get things done, my uncanny ability to put any and every thing off till the last possible second, and all the reasons we fit together so perfectly that defy all logic and reason.

# God Loves Fags.

[[Jenn]], SusanThomas, JanS, KarenL, KirstenHaberer, and I all went to the Laramie Project yesterday. It was very moving and touching. It's basically this group of actors that act out a series of interviews they did of the people surrounding MatthewSheppard and his horrific death. I felt it was a little longer than it needed to be, and it should have started much earlier in the evening, but I enjoyed it a lot. We had dinner at Little Tibet, which was yummy as always.

Today was the Linux Fest that the USSG puts on every year at the IMU. I picked up TimCarper and we headed over to the IMU, we circled around for about 30 minutes looking for a space, but god damn if every parking space wasn't filled. Meh. We eventually gave up and parked in a metered lot. I went to the Fest, it was kind of interesting, but not that much. Some pretty pictures, and the 3d environment stuff was cool. But *shrug*

I got to see [[Jenn]] for lunch, we went to Quiznos, which rules. It was a nice lunch, we made fun of stupid people who randomly started parking in bizarre places for no apparent reason.

After lunch I went back to work, to meet Chad, who is my equivalent in IUPUI. I was expecting another guy in his late 20s-mid 30s who was all stuffy, but a 20 something punk showed up with a piercing or 4 and I felt a sigh of relief. He seems like a cool guy, I think we'll work well together.

I cut my finger badly... it hurts and is yucky looking :(

I should add a FavoriteRestaurants and FavoriteTVshows list.

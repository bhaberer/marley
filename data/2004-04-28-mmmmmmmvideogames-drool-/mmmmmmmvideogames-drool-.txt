# Mmmmmmmm..... Video Games *drool*

I got bored tonight and looked at gamespot.com for the first time in a long time. Saw some neat things.

* [http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/metroidprime2tentativetitle/news_6094646.html Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]: Will support 4-Way multi-player action. Neato.
* [http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/zeldafourswords/preview_6027728.html The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures]: Should be out some time this summer... I'm a sucker for Zelda games. :)
* [http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/puzzle/warioware/index.html Wario Ware: Mega Party Game$]: I had no idea this came out... guess I should read Penny Arcade more often.
* [http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/index.html We should all be afraid of how much I may have to play this game]. :)

Anyway, enough about video games. 

Last night [[Jenn]] and I finished watching "Bowling for Columbine" which was pretty good. I like Michael Moore. I'm going to go home in a bit and sleep happily for a while, in a while.

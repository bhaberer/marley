For some reason that puts a big smile on my face. :) {nid 1LL}

I went biking yesterday, went about 3-4 miles, with a not-very-small chunk of the distance through very thick mud. pedaling through mud is shitty, and I was about dead when I got home... I really got to find a way not to have to bike uphill the whole way home... but I think it's just the breaks from living on top of a hill. :P {nid 1LM}

lots of cleaning today, and we have a guest coming tomorrow... wheee... so much fun :) {nid 1LN}

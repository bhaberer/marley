# Wheeeee.... I'm dumb.

Well no upgrades on [[Shiva]] for now, I accidentally ordered an OEM CPU instead of a retail one.

Well no upgrades on [[Shiva]] for now, I accidentally ordered an OEM CPU instead of a retail one. And the OEM CPUs don't come with a heat sink, so I have to wait until my [http://www.zalmanusa.com/usa/product/view.asp?idx=79&code=005 Zalman Copper Heat sink] comes in the mail from Newegg, maybe Wednesdayish.  I feel dumb, but oh well.

I went climbing for the first time in too long this weekend. [[Jenn]] and I went on Friday on Saturday. I need to keep going, I'm pretty rusty. I climbed a couple 5.8's and a 5.8+ but nothing impressive. I'm pretty sore still, but I hope to be less sore by Tuesday so I can drag Jenn down there again. When I was at the gym I saw a [http://www.backcountrygear.com/catalog/accessdetail.cfm/NA1040 Nalgene Splash Guard] I got it and it's awesome, it allows for chugging from Nalgene bottles without getting one's shirt wet, which is always a plus in my book.

Seen a couple movies, not much that's too great. Saturday I saw [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200530/ Chuck&Buck] a mildly entertaining movie, it was fairly painful to watch. I also saw [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/ Napoleon Dynamite] which I liked a lot more. I don't really recommend either one a whole lot, but I liked ND a lot more.

I might be able to fanagle my friend to let me play the beta of World of Warcraft. But I have to keep threate... err... asking him nicely about it. ;) I've been watching the latest game play videos and they are pretty awesome, it's still technically slated for a November release, so here's hoping it doesn't get pushed back another year.

Thats it for now.

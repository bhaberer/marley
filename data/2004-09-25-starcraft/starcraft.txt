Star Craft--

So because I'm annoyed that I've not gotten a [http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/ Beta Invite] yet, I went out and finally purchased [http://www.blizzard.com/war3x/ Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne]

So because I'm annoyed that I've not gotten a [http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/ Beta Invite] yet, I went out and finally purchased [http://www.blizzard.com/war3x/ Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne], the expansion to the incredible RTS [http://www.blizzard.com/war3/ Warcraft III] in which Blizzard fixed all the problems with their interfaces and made up for StarCraft.

I don't, and didn't like StarCraft. Lots of people seem to think that makes me a gaming mutant. I don't know, the plot was never all that interesting, and the game play always felt cumbersome. The game felt even more unsatisfying since I had been a big CommandandConquer Addict. 

C&C was a much better series than the StarCraft series has been so far. I hope they abandon the whole "Generals" crap and go back to the original GDI/NOD Conflict. And, who can forget the shiny happy C&C installer. I know I'm a dork, leave me alone. :) I mean hell, even Total Annihilation was more fun than StarCraft... hey I should dig that game out and play some... it was sweet.

I finished the WC3: The Frozen Throne Night Elf campaign yesterday the game bridges the plot between WC3 and WoW, so I thought it would be a good idea to figure out what happened :) I beta tested The Frozen Throne, but I never got around to buying it when it came out, I think I was addicted to SWG by that point... not sure. I know I was taking a load of crap from my girlfriend for playing WC3 too much at that point... hmmm... *shrug* Anyway, the game is pretty cool, things feel like they got balanced decently. I've been playing online games with one of the people I played WoW with, it's been good time, if anyone else has the game and wants to play some, let me know. 

I've got a doctors appointment in about an hour... good times, I've not been to see a doctor in like a few years... I guess I should watch that. There was more I wanted to blog about but I'm pulling a blank, if anything comes to me after the Dr. appointment, I'll post it :)

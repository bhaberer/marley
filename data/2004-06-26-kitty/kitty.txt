# Kitty!

We got the kitten after all, I think [[Jenn]] wants to name it Charlie. The shelter had named it Donald, but I'm not a huge, huge fan of either name. But I can't think of anything better, I kind of liked 'cinder' but Jenn insists it's a girl's name. Anyway, here are some pictures.

Cleo is very annoyed at the intrusion of a new cat, so that's what we're doing right now, making sure they don't kill one another. :-\

Musings on historical blindspots.

It's nice to know that the United States isn't the only country that likes to pretend it's never wrong. The GaijinSmash guy talks a little about the Japanese war self denial. It's a weird feeling... it's not so much that I'm 'glad' that the US isn't the only country that pretends that the wars that we didn't win, didn't really happen. But, it makes me feel a little less horrible about the things our history book glosses over. 

Should we gloss over the future, and work to instill some sort of pride in our country? It's hard to say. On the one hand I think that people need to be able to have that pride in our country to stand up against genuinely horrible people doing genuinely horrible things. Granted, that hasn't happened very often recently. The obvious counter point is that when you cram patriotism down people's throats all their lives, it tends to rot their brains to the point where the US can do no wrong. Where we should draw the line is really hard to decide. Do you show that famous picture of the Vietnamese kid getting shot to 4th graders? How about high schoolers? I never saw anything nearly that graphic in any of my history classes (and in fact didn't see that image till I hit college at some point. Yay internet), even the one where the teacher lamented about the horrible atrocities that the US has engaged in that were just omitted from our books. 

I recently saw two movies that I've been meaning to mention. They are two sides of the battle for Iwo Jima, Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. Both of these movies I've watched twice now, and both were very intense. Neither one feels like a glamorous retelling of the war on either side. The battle was long, it was a horrendous loss of life (of 22,000 Japanese troops, 20,000 died) for both sides, and the outcome was known before the first troops landed on the beach. Flags tells the story of the fight from the American side, and details the post battle exploits of the three soldiers who were in the flag raising photo. Letters tells the story from the Japanese point of view, interspersed with flashbacks of the soldiers as they write letters to their loved ones. I found that I liked letters a bit more, but I highly recommend both movies. Not since Grave of the Fireflies have I been this moved by a war movie (Incidentally, if you have never seen Grave of the Fireflies, you should go rent it now, or borrow it from me).

# And now for something completely different.

I'm not one to normally one to link to Eminem, but the [http://www.gnn.tv/content/eminem_mosh.html Mosh Video] is an exception. I'm pretty amazed. Eminem++ There is a torrent and TRL link [http://www.musicforamerica.org/node/view/63521 here].  {nid 1EM}

You should vote in this election. Even if you vote for the ass we have in office who has no problem sending the children of hundreds of parents to their death when he never even showed up for his duty, you should vote. But, if you like to have leaders with reason and intelligence in their foreign policy, and you don't want to worry about being drafted to support Bush's Vietnam, I encourage you even more. I'm going to vote, even though it won't make a difference in this state, but who cares, just vote.

Last Thursday I went down to Evansville to build my Mom's computer. I got it all installed and they seem to love it, so I'm happy I was able to give my Mom a decent computer at last. I also took her out to Dinner at her favorite Mexican Resturaunt.  {nid 1EO}

While I was in Evansville my exhaust pipe broke, evidently it had been rusting on either side of the catalytic converter. They replaced the whole mess, and it set me back $200... bah...  {nid 1EP}

This last weekend was great times. Paul, Jason, and Sara came down for JoeBlaylock's Halloween party. It was a lot of fun and there was a lot of craziness. It was nice seeing people I haven't for a while and getting a bit drunk and having fun. [[Jenn]] was able to come to the party she came as a Catholic School-girl and I came as a Priest.  {nid 1EQ}

I also got to finally introduce [[Jenn]] to Jason and Sara, that was cool, I'm glad that all my friends have finally met the woman I love. :)  {nid 1ER}

Jason's been talking about the Dayton LAN Fest that's happening sometime in March, it sounds like a lot of fun. I might end up helping out for the event that's supposed to be a 300 or so person lanfest. GoodTimes.  {nid 1ES}

I've had my GBA SP addiction rekindled by Sara. I started playing FF:T again. I love my GBA. Although I will say that it's weird that when my crappy replacement adapter died (my original wandered off), I couldn't find a decent replacement for the adapter. I finally found one at Gamestop after going to Best Buy, Circuit City, Borders, Target, and Electronic Boutique. Sara and I played some Zelda over GBA connections, which was fun... :) {nid 1ET}

I wish I had found [http://www.pcgameworld.com/article.php/id/244/ this thing] a few months ago. I may get this so we don't have to remember the freakish way everything is connected. But I don't know enough about it yet, so we will see. {nid 1EU}

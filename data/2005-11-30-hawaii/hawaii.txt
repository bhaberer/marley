# Hawaii, wheee...

So last Wednesday [[Jenn]] and I headed off to Hawaii for a few days, it was good fun. What follows is a far-too-long account of that trip. {nid 1ZP}

So last Wednesday [[Jenn]] and I headed off to Hawaii for a few days, it was good fun. What follows is a far-too-long account of that trip. {nid 1ZP}

==== Wednesday {nid 1ZQ} ====

:We got up at *groan* 5am (I couldn't get to sleep till 4:10 or so) and headed up to Indy, we caught our first flight at 9amish, and flew to Chicago, and then flew from there to Hawaii, that flight is a long-assed flight. We got into Maui at about 4-5pm Maui time which is like 11pm Indiana time. We unpacked and had some dinner with Dad, Joanne and Tommy (my stepbrother). After that we promptly passed out.  {nid 1ZR}

:The condo we stayed in was a [http://www.maui.net/~lokcondo/ Lokelani] condo which is on the NW side of the island, my father owns a unit, so it was nice. The units are about [http://mauilokelani.com/db3/00212/mauilokelani.com/_uimages/PalmII.jpg 20' from the water]. It was hot. {nid 1ZS}

==== Thursday {nid 1ZU} ====

:Thursday we got up and had a nice breakfast of papaya (Yum, Yum), and headed down to Lahaina, a town near where we stayed. There was a artist festival and I got a couple prints. One was by a guy who uses fire to produce his art ([http://www.swisscafe.net/artists/brian/bryanpage.htm read about it here]) I got one of a Hawaiian warrior, I like it a lot. I also got a print of a watercolor piece of two turtles.  {nid 1ZV}

:Later in the day Joanne made Thanksgiving dinner. The meal was fairly 'normal' Turkey, stuffing and such... it was all excellent. Kudos to Joanne for pulling of a wonderful thanksgiving despite being several thousand miles from a place where turkeys actually live. :) Joanne also made a macadamia nut pie, which was extremely rich, but good. I don't think I needed anymore than I had.  {nid 1ZW}

==== Friday {nid 1ZX} ====

:Friday we went to the beach in the morning and had a picnic with everyone. I mostly played GBA since I'm a dork.  {nid 1ZY}

:Later that evening we went and saw a theatrical production called [http://www.ulalena.com/ Ulalena]. It was very interesting. It's a musical that goes over the history of the Hawaiian people in a vaguely Cirque du Soleil fashion. [http://www.ulalena.com/video.html Quick-time preview]. I enjoyed it, but felt it wasn't fantastic or anything.  {nid 1ZZ}

==== Saturday {nid 200} ====

:Saturday we traveled a ways to [http://www.mauioceancenter.com/home.html The Maui Ocean Center] an aquarium in SW Maui. It was really cool, they had a cylindrical tube full of Jellyfish and a clear tube through a tank with tiger sharks, reef sharks, and Manta Rays. It was sweet.  {nid 201}

:Later in the day we all went on a sunset boat trip. Where we were treated to well MaiTais and a nice view of the incoming storm. We also found out just how seasick Jenn gets. I won't embarrass her with any more details including the colors she turned when we hit a big wave. :) {nid 202}

==== Sunday {nid 203} ====

:Sunday we headed back to Indiana. We left at 5pm Sunday afternoon and got home about 12pm noon Indiana time. It was a long assed day.  {nid 204}

It was a nice little trip. One of my personal high points was walking out to the seawall 20' from my condo's deck and sitting on the wall drinking Coronas watching the waves crash in for about 3 hours on Saturday night. I can't recall being that content and at peace for a long time.  {nid 205}

Good Stuff. {nid 206}

Next blog entry will be drowning in needless consumer-whorism. Just a warning.  {nid 207}

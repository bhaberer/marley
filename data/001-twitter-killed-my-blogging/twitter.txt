# Twitter Killed my Blogging (2010/03/08)

I had grand plans for this blog at some point, but I don't really remember what they were. They were probably lost when I dedicated the majority of my online energy to twitter. I think that twitter's low commitment is great for keeping in touch on a surface level, but it makes it so easy for people (i.e. myself) to avoid writing anything of substance while masquerading behind a flood of information. Combined with my laziness, this creates a problem.

Combined with my laziness, this creates a problem.

I feel that I want to try and get back to working on my writing, and writing something of substance. I don't write enough as it is, and relegating myself to tweets and terse emails isn't going to help me move in a positive direction in that regard. So, I'm going to try and write something, anything really, in this space at least once a week.Â  Maybe no one will read it and maybe it will be horribly written, but that's the way things have to be sometimes.

Topics will range from video game theory, beer snobbery, or maybe just whatever hilarious thing my cat(s) just did. I'm going to try and stay more on topics that are interesting as opposed to faking news or attempting to conjure an interesting journal of the mundane events of my life.

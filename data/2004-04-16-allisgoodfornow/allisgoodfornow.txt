# No more Drama for now.

So I've had a long week at work, on Tuesday I was told that an employee at UITS had been [[RIF]]ed, and was exercising his bumping rights to take my job. Since I had only been on my job for a week he had seniority over me, and so that's legal. {nid FW}

I got this note from my Boss on Wednesday. {nid FX}

:I wanted to talk with you today. I came looking for you a couple of times and once you were on the phone and another time not at your cube. I had a very busy day full of meetings. Toma told me that she briefly talked with you yesterday and explained the situation we have with an UIS employee that is being RIF'ed and as part of the HR RIF process the employee has the right exercise a bump into a position that they qualify and the person has less seniority. You are in this position. Well our meeting with Dennis and Debby tomorrow is to discuss this and provide you with an option. NOBODY will be losing their jobs so I don't want you to worry. I apologize for not being able to talk with you in person today. {nid FZ}

So that was a huge hit to my generally happy mood that I've been in over the past few weeks. I had a meeting on Thursday where DanMiller, DennisCromwell, and an HR person broke the news to me and told me my options. The best option was for me to take Bill's old job, but that meant going back to thirds which was not something I wanted to do. {nid G0}

However, yesterday I got this letter from DanMiller. {nid G1}

:I have some good news! The RIF.ed employee has revoked their bumping rights on your position. That means you will stay on days and in the PA12 Operations Analyst position. However with one covet the RIF.ed employee will have 60 days to find a new position within the University or bump another position. It could be possible that they might reconsider your position and exercise their bumping rights again (this is highly unlikely but not out of the question). {nid G2}

So I'm staying optimistic and trying not to think about it too much. Here's hoping that I never have to think about it again. {nid G3}

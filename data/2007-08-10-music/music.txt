# New Music

New music in my life.

I’m digging last.fm, but I’m not using it much for listening to the music that last.fm suggests for me. I’ve been using it’s music tracking features a lot (you’ll see that plainly if you vist my blog’s homepage), A lot of their design is pretty slick.

Speaking of music, I have been picking up some new music, figured I’d share.

LCD Soundsystem - Sound of Silver
---------------------------------

I picked up LCD Soundsystem’s new cd the other week. LCD Soundsystem is a really random band I got tuned onto by a friend by the name of Aiden (Who has since vanished from the face of the earth). The info says that the music could be described as “as a mix of dance music and punk, along with elements of disco and other styles”, and that’s pretty accurate, but it’s worth giving a listen. The new cd is pretty good, I’m digging it, but there is one song, 'Someone Great' that’s just amazing, I can’t really describe why I keep playing this song so much, but I’m not alone it would seem. Overall if you liked the first LCD cd then you’ll most likly like the second. it’s better in some ways, and shows a bit in the way of an evolution of their sound. If you’ve never heard LCD and you have some interest, let me know I’ll let you bum my copy ( or at least the 0 and 1’s ) to let you decide if you need to own a copy.

Mock Orange - Daniels EP
------------------------

I also picked up Mock Orange’s duel EP with The Band apart. I snaged this EP from a friend in Mock Orange when they played here recently. It’s pretty good. I am digging on The Band Apart’s song led and Mock Orange’s new single ‘Beauty of a Scar’. I hope I get to catch The Band Apart when they come tour here.

Coconut Records - Nighttiming
-----------------------------

I randomly came across this album. This is some music done by Jason Schwartzman, who people might remember as the kid from the movie “Rushmore”. A couple songs are pretty decent, but it’s still on my “maybe” pile. But, I dig the song West Coast.

Other Random Music
------------------

* I’m loving Asian Kung-Fu Generation even if I can’t understand the words.
* Alex Mauer’s chiptune album ‘System of a Master’ is pretty wonderful
* I’m listening to some !!!. Not sure if I like it much yet, but I’m digging a few tracks here and there.

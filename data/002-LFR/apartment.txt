# Looking for a roommate (2010/08/31)

<a style="float: left; padding: 0 10px 10px;" title="Cloud View by weirdo513, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/weirdo513/4314244347/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2695/4314244347_51e1a2bd8d_m.jpg" alt="Cloud View" width="240" height="161" /></a>So Jenn is heading off to UC Davis in the fall. I won't be going with her due to many reasons, not the least of which that finding an interesting job in this economy was hard enough in the bay area. So to make the rent a little more manageable, I'm looking for someone interested in living on the peninsula.

The apartment is a reasonable two bedroom affair in San Carlos. There's a deck out back, and a reasonable sized backyard. There is also a garage for storage (or parking), and on-site laundry machines.

The apartment's location is set back from El Camino and up the side of a hill by a block or two. This allows for a pretty ridiculous view, and on a clear day I can make out houses on the other side of the bay. The neighborhood is nice, clean, and quiet. It's close to most of the things you need; groceries, pizza, deli, sushi, a decent place to get a drink, etc. are all within a 2-5 minute car trip or 5-15m walk. The apartment is about .6 miles from the San Carlos Caltrain station, and about ~5mins from 101 depending on the traffic.

About me; I'm 28 and married (obviously). I was born in Colorado and raised in Indiana, but I managed to escape from the mid-west mostly unscathed. I'm fairly easy going and easy to get along with. I'm a very dedicated gamer (video or otherwise), an amateur photographer, rare and craft beer enthusiast, and an avid consumer of most forms of digital entertainment. I've been known to rock climb, white water raft, or snowboard, but I've not done any of the the three much since I moved to California. I keep a twitter feed at http://twitter.com/weirdo513 that might give a good idea of who I am.

I'm looking for a roommate starting approximately August. Rent is $800 plus half of utilities (power/gas/internet [water/trash paid by landlord]). Those interested should contact brian.apt.hunting@gmail.com or just leave a comment.

# Another Random Movie Review

'''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212974/ Groove]'''
A movie that's mostly about a rave being put on in San Francisco. It had some great music (digweed, hybrid, Orbital, etc) and nice cinematography. I think it decent job of capturing the feel of a rave, though I've never been to a real rave just some pathetic wannabe parties. :) But, I enjoyed the movie overall and reccomend it if you have any interest in this kind of thing.

# No one cares, But whoohoo anyway.

So I play this game called World of Warcraft a lot. And, I do mean a _lot_. I currently have a level 60 Druid, level 37 warlock, level 20 mage and level 15 warrior on the stormreaver server of the game. I'm the leader of one of the top 10 alliance guilds on the server, and within a few weeks I'll probably have over 200 people who I'm leading on a daily basis... {nid 1SQ}

This is where most people stop paying attention, but stick with me I have a point here, kinda.  {nid 1SR}

So last night after about a week of planning and work, I organized a 40 person group in game.  {nid 1SS}

We gathered, worked as a team and managed to almost take down one of the single most difficult bosses on the server, it was a feat that stunned a lot of people in bigger, more established guilds. I had numerous people thank me for my hard work and dedication, and there was much rejoicing.  {nid 1SU}

I felt on top of the world because of all this, but when I went to share my excitement with my friends outside the game I realized no one would really care. Because every time I bring up World of Warcraft people get this look in their eyes like "it's just a video game, and a complete and utter waste of time". And I always feel depressed when I realize that something I take seriously and invest a significant amount of energy and emotional capital into is dismissed as useless by so many of my peers.  {nid 1SW}

A year ago I didn't have a minute amount of the assertiveness or organizational and leadership abilities that leading this guild and being forced to take an active leadership roll have instilled in me... and so I feel these games are at least of some usefulness on that most basic level. {nid 1SX}

When friends like Boco bring up obscure Anime or Jenn geeks out about some obscure psychology thing that I may not have any prior interest in I don't roll my eyes or dismiss it as useless because these people care deeply for these things and being their friend means I should care about what they find interesting. If they are so interested in a subject I at least owe it to them to have some ability to empathize with what it is that they are passionate about... {nid 1SY}

I don't expect people to be incredibly interested and I do not want people to placate me... but I guess I wish that I could discuss it without feeling ashamed that so many people think that my particular passion is worthless. {nid 1SZ}

That's it. {nid 1T0}

'''Note: I just wanted to note that this is not directed at my lovly fiancee [[Jenn]] who is probably the most interested in the dynamics of how the game works, and I love her for that. Sorry if I made it seem like I was complaining about you honey. *hugs*'''

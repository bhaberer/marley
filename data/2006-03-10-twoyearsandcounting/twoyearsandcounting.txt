# Two Years and Counting...

Last weekend was [[Jenn]] and my Two Year anniversary.

Last weekend was [[Jenn]] and my Two Year anniversary. We had a lot of fun, we got up and went to UU church together because Jenn wanted to start going. It was an ok service. I dug on the sermon itself, but not on the stand-up, sing, sit down sing, stand up sing, etc.

Jenn has been wanting to go, but doesn't want to go alone. So I called a friend of mine named Karen, who is like my surrogate Bloomington Mother. And so now Jenn and Karen are going to church, and all is well. I have to sleep all day Sunday sadly. {nid 26S}

We spent the rest of the day together, and made dinner, and opened a bottle of wine we bought last anniversary. It was nice.  {nid 26T}

OH! and Jenn got me a bike rack, which means I no longer have to disassemble my bike to take it anywhere. Which is a definite win. :) Now... where did I put my U-Lock... {nid 26U}

# Game Boy DS.

So I got to finally play with one of the new fangled Game Boys that Nintendo has put out. I was not thrilled with it at first, it looked heavy and awkward and not useful. However on Friday my Battery died in my car so I had to spend some time in Sears while they checked my electrical system and replaced my battery, and so being the dork that I am, I wandered down to EB to check one out. {nid 1JF}

I played with pictochat for a while, not too impressive, but cool if more of my friends were the kind to have game boys, which they are not. Ingrates. {nid 1JG}

The Metroid game was far more impressive. It was a lot of fun and the graphics were surprisingly nicely done. The control were a bit hard to get accustomed to, but they felt right after a while, and I can only imagine get easier after more than an hour's use. I borrowed the clerk's DS to hold one that was not bolted to the wall, and it felt surprisingly nice, and light. I have big hands and I always feel like the SP was a bit too small, though not uncomfortable. {nid 1JH}

I think I might get one after a few decent games come out. Oh! BoCo just sent me [http://server1.vortiginous.com/ds-pix/GameSizes.JPG this picture of the game sizes] which is neat! {nid 1JI}

I'm such a dork  {nid 1JJ}

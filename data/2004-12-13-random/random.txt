# Some random updates, because I'm a slacker and haven't updated in a while.

So what's been going on in the life of Brian? {nid 1JK}

* Moved in with the lovely [[Jenn]], when has been proving to be wonderful. I'm very, very happy. :) I've still got a lot of crap at the apartment, but I'm working on getting it all over here. {nid 1JL}
* I fried my video card last night... somehow... I already ordered a new ATI 9600XT to hold me over. I'm not sure if I'll want to get a newer one in a few months or not. I'm still pretty annoyed that it just up and died on me. {nid 1JM}
* paulv had a party this weekend. It was double-plus good. Paulv++ We played "Eat poop you cat" and I have the results that I'm going to scan in eventually. {nid 1JN}

I'm going to try and have daily strips working again soon. and maybe even the old blog entries, but I'm not promising anything. The lure of WoW, she is seductive and great. {nid 1JO}

More later! :) It's time to go cuddle up with Jenn and sleep.  {nid 1JP}

# Jenn has moved.

So the last few days have been spent slaving, err I mean happily working to get [[Jenn]] moved from the apartment into the Condo. IT was a lot of moving and car trips between the two places but we are finally finished! So that's cool.

Sunday JoeBlaylock, AnamiSheppard, and BrettSmith came and helped us move the big furniture. I had fun even tho I had to drive the largest vehicle I've ever driven, a 17' UHaul truck. It was a bit of a pain, since I was kind of low on sleep, having had been up all Saturday, and worked all night. Sheesh :)

[[Jenn]] and I celebrated finishing the move last night with a trip to Asuka.  It was a good time. Today I bummed around the Condo a bit, and we put together Jenn's new bed. It's pretty damn cool.

I'm working on the new laptop a lot. It's coming along. I'm struggling with Linux's overall brokenness coupled with IU's love of Microsoft. I think I finally got my ConnectScript working. So that's good. having working IU wireless is a big win. I'm hoping to be done with the IMS stuff soon so I can start working on populating the database.

That's it for now. Have a great week people.

# My Head...

Anyway on to interesting stuff. Today there was gaming going on down at Brandon's house near Bedford. So after I finished reworking the network earlier in the day I packed up [[Shiva]] and [[Ark]] into my car and headed down with TimCarper and Jeremy in tow. We got there a little late, but we beat most people there so we didn't feel too bad. 

There was a lot of BF1942 played, and 9 people showed up, Phill, Brandon, Tim, Lane, Jeremy, Me, Vonbrown, Phatjesus, and some guy whose name and handle escape me. it was nice but all that computer equipment heated up the room and I started feeling sick/head-achy from the heat. I ducked out around 10:30 and headed home. I'm about to goto sleep now, kind of ok day, I got stuff done and I saw the guys, but *shrug* my heart just wasn't in it today.

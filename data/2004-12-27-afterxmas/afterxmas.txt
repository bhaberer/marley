# The day after Christmas.

So yesterday we went shopping at the mall for a couple things. One thing was that KB Toys was going out of business and we wanted to pick up a board game if they had anything decent left. They didn't have much at all but we did walk away with [http://www.unclesgames.com/product_info.php?ref=3&products_id=5461&affiliate_banner_id=1 The Game of Life: The Simpsons Edition]. So that's cool. We're kind of lacking in the board games department, but now we have Life, Monopoly, Jenga (my jenga is scary old, the box says it's from like 1987 or something), Chess, Scrabble, and Lunch Money. {nid 1KA}

We also stopped by EB where I finished out [[Jenn]]'s Christmas present. We exchanged her GBA SP for a Classic NES SP, and I got her the other game she wanted, Super Mario Brothers. She seemed pretty happy. :) {nid 1KB}

I had something intelligent to talk about... but it's gone now, I'm just going to go to sleep instead of figuring it out. {nid 1KC}

# I got my camera finally.

Today I went into Roberts intent on striking some sort of bargain for a D80. I'd gotten tired of waiting patiently for my dammed camera.

I've been waiting on D80 body, but they have been in short supply. Sounds like Nikon is hoarding them in order to repackage them with the new VR lens at some point in the future, or something. I talked with the owners and we struck a deal for D80 kit, and they bought the kit lens back for the difference between the kit price and the body only price, effectively selling me a body for the retail price. So, rock on Roberts++, I'm glad I was able to give them my business, even if it took forever.

I spent some time playing with the camera for a few hours today and upped some photos I took around the house. The weather was pretty overcast and boring, so there wasn.t much outside to test shoot. But the cats were good enough. After Jenn went to bed I figured out some more controls, and look forward to poking at things more tomorrow.

For some reason this is my favorite shot of the day:

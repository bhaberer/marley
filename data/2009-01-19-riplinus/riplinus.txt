# Rest in Peace, Linus.

Linus passed away this afternoon due to an apparent heart attack he suffered going through airport security.

Linus passed away this afternoon due to an apparent heart attack he suffered going through airport security. He was doing fine when he suddenly passed out and became unresponsive. That's all we really know. I imagine my wife was about the closest thing to a vet they had on hand.

Linus was the most recent addition to our little family of felines. He had been hanging around outside the condo in Bloomington for a while. Jenn took a shine to him, and started feeding him. She was wary of contact, as someone in the neighborhood had told her that he was FIV+. But, after a while she caught him in a cage in order to take him in to get neutered and checked for diseases like FIV. The results came back that he was FIV-, so that was good.

The bad news was that the neutering place was full of fail, and didn't use any antibiotics during the surgery. This lead to Linus getting massively infected in his private area. Jenn kept him inside and fed him antibiotics and nursed him back to health. And, as would be expected if you know my wife, she decided to keep him, and expand our family to four cats.

I was never Linus' biggest fan, he didn't particularly like me or my tendency to suddenly bolt out of my room, run downstairs for something and run back upstairs. He also liked to terrorize Tabitha, who is my most favoritist cat evar. I wouldn't say I hated him at all, as there have been cats I've hated in the past, but we never really got too close. He was definitely Jenn's cat, much like Puck.

However, I will miss him. He was a good buddy for Puck to fight with, and Jenn and him got along really well. Rest in peace, Linus.

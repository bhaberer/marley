# No Florida, but a merry Christmas!

So we got up to Indy Thursday. And after shoveling the driveway clear of a freakish amount of snow (pictures are up here: http://weirdo513.org/gallery/snow2004 [No artistic intent]), we headed out to the airport to leave for Florida. So, after dealing with the 2' or so of snow we have around here, and after realizing we left critical things behind in Bloomington, and after we heard that our flight had been delayed for at the very least 2 hours... we said fuck it.  {nid 1K3}

So we're staying here in Bloomington for Christmas. We've got a bunch of alcohol, and food and movies and we have no intention of driving anywhere in this mess. It's been a lot of fun.  {nid 1K4}

Tonight, we're having a random Christmas Dinner evidently. I'll report how it goes off later. I think BrettSMith is going to come, but I think everyone else I know actually got away for the holidays. I'm going to try and make green bean casserole of some sort, my Mom used to make it lots, and I hope I don't fuck it up. [[Jenn]] is making stuffing, and we're also making some kind of broccoli/cauliflower dish that looked good. Maybe something else but I think that's it.  {nid 1K5}

We had already opened our presents last weekend in preparation for leaving this Thursday, so I have no presents to open! which sucks :) But, I'm happy with my presents this year. I got a lot of cool things like A futurama Boxxed set, and an ungodly amount of PJ pants.... my dad has... unique... ideas of style, and got me some spongbob and monkey PJ pants... which are scary, but I like wearing the monkey ones cause Jenn yells at me. ;) {nid 1K6}

The best thing I got this year was from a joint venture by Jenn, Mom, Jan, Dad, and Joanne. They each donated money so that I could get a brand new Trek bike! I'm so happy I can't wait till I can go down and test drive a couple... I know I already journaled about it, but it bears repeating in my Christmas post.   {nid 1K7}

Oh, and congrats to Jason and Sara who are now engaged! People need to stop getting engaged it's freaking me out ;) {nid 1K8}

This has been a great and wonderful Christmas. I hope everyone is having as much fun as I am. {nid 1K9}

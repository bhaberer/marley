# I Love Finals Week, and other stories.

Lots of things going on, nothing of much substance, so I won't pretend this is that interesting.

AI Class
--------

I have a few days left to finish my Neural Network for Intro AI. It is mostly done, aside from some obnoxious behavior in the learning, but I think I have tracked down the cause. 

My AI Final Will start 12am Thursday and end at 7pm on Friday. Take home. 20 essays. Fun stuff.

I think that while mildly interesting when used in conjunction to game playing and puzzle solving; I generally find AI boring and tedious most of the time, and will not be pursuing it. Just my opinion.

Random Notes
------------

* This coming weekend Tim will be coming down for video games and other chicanery. I'm looking forward to a weekend of drunken relaxing and amusing gaming.
* Joe finished his last paper today, and barring some insane twist, he should be a bona fide graduate now. What a sellout.
* I will have my D80 in a week or two. It will be good times.
* I dove in to Rails and Ruby hardcore for a few days, much to the detriment of my neural network's progress, but that's not important. I like Ruby/Rails so far and hope to continue my learning once this stupid week is done.

Cleo
----

In more somber news, I'll be staying here this Christmas season because Jenn's oldest (13+ years) cat Cleo has an overactive thyroid. This means she has to undergo a procedure in Indy next week where she'll be injected in Radio-Iodine, and isolated for about a week in Indy. Jenn's taking it pretty hard, but we found out today that the cancer (overactive thyroid = cancer in cats I guess?) hasn't spread at all, so the treatment should save her. If you have any interest in this stuff you can read about what's going on at http://radiocat.com Needless to say we aren't going to leave while the cat's in recovery, but Jenn's mother is planning on coming to visit, so that will be cool.

My holiday plans are pretty much completely up in the air right now, as I really haven't had the mental energy to figure out where and how available I'll be, but I'll figure it out next week.

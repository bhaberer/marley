Last weekend was a lot of fun. PaulVisscher showed up and crashed and my and BrettSmith's place for the weekend. It was good times. He put up with Brett and I playing large amounts of games throughout the weekend... what a sport. We went and visited work when Paul got here and visited with ChrisDent and MatthewOconnor. We made fun of their computers and I eventually gave paul and Brett a mini tour of the MachineRoom, but they had already seen it before so they were not horrifically impressed. They were not even impressed by the coke machine. I mean... sheesh... some people need to learn to be amused by the simple shiney things in life sometimes. :)

Also last weekend JoeBlaylock had a random party that was a lot of fun. Alcohol, talk of vibrators, discussions of the Michigan swinger scene, contemplations on the deep meaning of life, and lots of other randomness... good times. :) I brought [[Jenn]] and she seemed to be having a good time, I know I had a blast. However because of work still being insane, I couldn't take the night off so we had to head out early which sucked.

But, I'll bitch about work and give updates on the [[IMS]] stuff later on tonight. But for now on with more of my random and boring life. :P

Sunday [[Jenn]] came over and hung out with Brett and I. Pizza was ordered and we snacked upon it while we started to watch the second Harry Potter movie which Jenn and Brett have not seen. About half way through the storms faired up and we stopped the movie. TimCarper randomly showed up after the storms and we all talked for a while it was cool to see him again. Paul showed back up a bit after that.

Tonight Jenn and I had a nice night out. We went out to Lennie's. I hope I ended Jenn's relatively horrible day on an upbeat. (her car go hit by some crazy lady) :(

Random Notes:

* I discovered that marsh sells Edamame. This is no good. I can go get a box of Edamame for like $2-3 and some other random Japanese food... yay.
* [[Jenn]] seems to have lain claim to my GBA SP and my WarioWare cart for satisfaction of her Dr. Mario habit.
* Due to me being poor and the fucked up situation Japan is out. I'll be lucky if I'll be able to take a vacation at the rate that my coworkers are dropping.
* I'm really tempted to get a USB key-chain drive. I'm just trying to decide on the $30 128mb one or the $60 256mb one.
* I'm working on a plan to hopefully head out to San Diego, Jenn's hometown, sometime later this summer. Should be a blast.

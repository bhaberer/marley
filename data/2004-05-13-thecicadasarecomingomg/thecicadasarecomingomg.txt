# Happidy Birthday!

First we have the short story of our being held for questioning by the IUPD :) So, last night [[Jenn]] nd I went out to Asuka for dinner, we got some Sake, edamame, a cucumber roll, and I got some Teryaki Chicken. Which was ever so good. Thanks for dinner [[Jenn]]! :)

Anyway, we were heading home and Jenn asked what was at the end of Pete Ellis. So I took her back there to show her the axillary Lilly Library Facility. Not much to see but whatever.  We turn around in the parking lot and head back toward my apartment when a cop pulls up behind us and turns on his lights. So we slow down of course and Jenn is kind of panicky. Because I'd had a small amount of Sake, but I hadn't been speeding or anything, so I calmly dealt with th cop who informed us that there had just been an alarm trip at the Lilly. So he directed us back to the lot and parked in the entry way so we couldn't make a break for it. So an unmarked cop car shows up... and an undercover cop car, and yet another normal cop car. They are all sitting around regarding us with suspicious stares. So after a bout 20 minutes of sitting in the car saying stupid things like "I wish I -had- robbed the damn place, then I'd have something to read while they search for the thieves." They finally gave us back our licenses and let us go after they searched our car. What are the odds?!? See if I ever show Jenn anything ever again! ;)

Later that evening I came home to find dozens of Cicadas crawling across the lawns and molting... freaky... no more pictures tho... don't worry :) There are little Cicada shells all over now tho.

I got off work early and went home to find [[Jenn]] had covered my whole floor in balloons! She rules so much.

Today my Dad showed up in town around one o'clock and we went to my apartment to hang out for a while. We talked for several hours about randomness. I showed him my latest technological toys. After a while we hooked up with Jenn and went out to eat at the Siam house. There was much Pad Thai. And Tom Khah Ghi Soup! I was happy. Dad also got some weird deserts, that were excellent.

Now I'm going to go fall asleep next to the woman I love. G'Night all.

# Good Times.

So I think we're going to name the kitty Puck... I think it's a suitable name but I still am leaning towards Socrates :) We took the little guy to the vet yesterday and got him his shots and such. He has ear-mites, poor fella. Cleo is not quite happy with him, but she seems to be warming up a little bit.

I sent my neuros in for repairs and upgrades. It's annoying not having it, I swear you get used to having your entire CD collection at your fingertips. I hope they get it back to me in the next few weeks because I am heading out to San Diego. Yes, I get to take a vacation! Evidently my boss thinks I need a vacation so much that they are reassigning someone from another shift to cover for me, so that's cool. I'll be in San Diego from 7/23 - 7/28. I can't wait!

Works been good I've been working on pruning back the mess that is the old console servers. I now have box of cat5 scraps from my efforts. I'm trying to make the shutdown we're doing in a few weeks as painless as possible.

The new C2 Coke is good it's like a mid-line between Coke (too much sugar) and diet coke (too little), I've been drinking a lot of it.

I got the new Steven King Dark Tower book, which I'm reading. I also got a few books and things from Karen, who went to the book expo.. good stuff I'll write more later.. I think I'm going to pass out if I don't goto bed tho...

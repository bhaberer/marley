# Early Birthday Present.

So, my birthday is next Thursday, and part of my present from my lovely girlfriend [[Jenn]] was tickets to Ani Difranco in Cincinnati. :)

So, my birthday is next Thursday, and part of my present from my lovely girlfriend [[Jenn]] was tickets to Ani Difranco in Cincinnati. :)

We left midway through the afternoon. I got sidetracked helping BoCo move out of the dorms. And helping my room mates parents help move Tim out of our apt. It was a crazy day. TimCarper moves out over the next few days, and BrettSmith will be moving in on Saturday. Fun Stuff.

So I went and picked up [[Jenn]] and we headed out to Cincy. It was a nice drive. I enjoy road trips with her a lot. We stopped along the way at a shifty Noble Romans... It was bad times. I was hoping against hope that the place would be passable... no such luck. *shudder*

After some confusion in Cincy as to where the theater was, we were on our way in to listen to Ani. The show was excellent, and thanks to the [http://www.neurosaudio.com miracle of modern technology] I have it recorded. (If you want a copy let me know, and I'll find a way to get you a copy.) She played 'As Is' and 'Subdivision' which was cool.

After the show we went and crashed at PaulVisscher's place. He was very cool to let us stay there. We sat up and bored Jenn with computer babble which she seemed passively interested in which was cool... I felt bad boring her like that tho :) The next morning we all got up and talked for a while more. It was decided to go get some food and we went to La Rosa's for lunch... yummy.

After that we headed home, and had another nice drive... tho it could have been 2 hours shorter and I would have been perfectly happy.

When we got home we chilled for a little bit, and then went over to the gym for a little exercise. That was fun if exhausting... the SRSC is a nice place.

We went and saw VanHelsing, and I swear I had so much hope for that movie... but it was so awful. I mean just every cliche in the book... and a tacky love story tacked on for no reason... and just... Arg. It could have been so much cooler if they had just done it right. But I mean there were times when I just hung my head in despair. There were a few cool points, don't get me wrong there... and the effects were mostly done well... and some of the jokes were even funny. But, overall it gets a C- in my book.

I'm at work now... I got word that my coworker had a heart attack and so he's out until the 12th. *sigh* That's annoying, tho sad. My sister was very cool and brought me some food since I can't go get it myself. She rules! :)

I see bears in my future tonight possibly... not sure. I got a wireless keyboard/mouse for Ark tonight so I may just figure out a reason to use them... hehe.

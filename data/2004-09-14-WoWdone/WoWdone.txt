# Blah.

The last week was spent playing a lot of World of Warcraft.

The last week was spent playing a lot of World of Warcraft. I'm still putting together a brain-dump of what I thought of the game, the short version is that I loved it, the longer version should be showing up later on today. Complete with screen shots and such.

This weekend was nice, Jenn and I went to a party on Saturday with people she's going to grad school with, and then on Sunday we went down to Evansville to get a tour of the brand new Central Library. The library is actually pretty dammed cool. The old Evansville Central Library was a small cramped 4-5 story building that was very old and only allowed the library to have like 30% of the collection of books out available to the public at any one time. The new facility is huge, and filled with new computers and nice furniture and stuff. I was fairly impressed.

I know it's old news and all... But Mike Krahulik, otherwise know as Gabe of Penny-Arcade had a child a few days ago. Jerry (aka Tycho, I don't know but ever since I met them in person I hate using their pseudo names) has a dialog about the thing up [http://www.penny-arcade.com/news.php3?date=2004-09-10 here]. Mike has a dialog about how hard it is to watch your wife get a C-Section [http://www.penny-arcade.com/news.php3?date=2004-09-13 here]. He named the kid Gabriel... I have a lot of things I could say about the whole thing but none of them are very important, just go read Tycho and Gabe's excellent words and look at baby Gabe. :)

I made [[Jenn]] dinner last night and then we made strawberry crepes... kind of... :) They were yummy. I'm going to head home and maybe finish up my WoW diatribe sometime in the next few hours.

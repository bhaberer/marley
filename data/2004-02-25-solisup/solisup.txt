Sol is working... yay.

I spent the morning hacking wiki, blosxom and other random code, and listening to a large amount of Barenaked Ladies. Good times. {nid 6R}

I went in to work and spent a while working on getting an IP assigned to Sol. When I hit a standstill I went with Matthew to grab some food at LaughingPlanet.  Yummy burrito goodness. I got Sol's network up with the help of StephanieBurks.  {nid 6S}

Tomorrow will include downloading and installing a large amount of crap, from wget to FireFox.  {nid 6T}

# Jenn is staying (I think)

Yay for staying home and doing laundry, and cleaning up the apartment. Maybe if I finish before the gym closes I'll head over there.

[[Jenn]] came by a few minutes ago and told me she made an offer on her condo... so hopefully she'll get word soon weather she got it or not... but I think this means she's staying :) yay.

Update: She is staying.

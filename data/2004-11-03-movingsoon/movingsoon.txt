# Moving on up to the... South side... hmmm...

So it's more-or-less official that I'm going to be moving in with [[Jenn]] come this winter break.  I'm very excited :) I'm looking for people interested in sub-leasing, but that will be taken care of eventually. I first met Jenn Jan. 23rd when she IMed me after finding me on friendster. I'm very much smitten with her, and for some reason she sees fit to tolerate me fairly regularly. What more can a guy ask for? :) {nid 1H3}

WoW came out in it's final stress test before the open beta that will preclude the retail release. I'm playing in it, I reccomend jumping in and giving the game a try during the open beta. If anyone wants to play with me I'll be "Xaithos" the Tauren Hunter on Test Server 6 (central PvP server). I'm having a lot of fun, and I'm very happy with the layer of polish they have added to the game. Stuff like an opening cinematic (which is very sweet), and lots of visual polish on rough edges really show how close the game is to release. {nid 1H4}

I'm not going to talk about stuff that happened yesterday, and is still happening today. I'm tired of it all... :) Al these stupid people in stupid states... 92% of people in Miss. voted to ban gay marriage.... I mean... that's just... I need a stiff drink :P {nid 1H5}

# San Diego - Day 4-5

On Monday we set out in the morning to head to the Zoo.

We stopped by [http://www.balboapark.org/ Balboa Park] on our way there. We wandered through the park and saw the various [http://weirdo513.org/gallery/album21/aaa arches] and [http://weirdo513.org/gallery/album21/aap ponds]. We stopped by the [http://www.balboapark.org/aboutgardens.html Botanical Gardens] and saw some neat plants. My favorites of course were the [http://weirdo513.org/gallery/album21/aal Venus Fly Traps] and the [http://weirdo513.org/gallery/album21/aan Pitcher Plants]. Carnivorous plants are just cool.

Next we headed to the [http://www.sandiegozoo.org/ San Diego Zoo], We saw lots of cool animals, I won't list every last one, cause I'm not that much of a dork. But there are a lot of pictures up in the gallery. It was a lot of fun, [[Jenn]] got me a souvenir stuffed turtle. :)

Later on we headed to [http://www.daveandbusters.com/?f=1 Dave & Busters] and played video games for a few hours. it was good times. [[Jenn]] totally schooled me in [http://www.skeeball.com/ Skeeball]... she's evil.

On Tuesday we got up and headed to [http://www.sannet.gov/lifeguards/beaches/mb.shtml Mission Beach] because [[Jenn]] hadn't gotten her beach fix for the trip yet. We laid out and I read my book ( [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1880418592/qid=1091148212/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-0553730-1771027?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 Song of Susannah (The Dark Tower, Book 6)] ) and Jenn read her Kurt V. book while we laid and got burned... It's a nice beach even if my skin is not too happy with me. 

Later on in the day we went out to dinner at a nice Mexican place with a few of Jenn's friends from high school. It was fun to meet some of her old friends.

After that, it was home to pack. I'll tell the drama of Jenn's flight home a bit later, I'm heading over to Jenn's to hang out and take a relaxing break from our busy vacation!

# Ryzom, Students, and other fun stuff.

So today is the day... the students are coming back.

So today is the day... the students are coming back. I can feel the town's collective IQ dropping as we speak. It's a sad sad thing. So I'll be hiding in my house for the next day or so to avoid the massive infusion of students on the roads, in my stores and downtown. I feel old saying that it's like "Keep those damn kids off mah lawn!".

A good point to the students coming back is that people like BoCo are back, which is good times. We hung out on Monday and there was playing of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles which is always a good time. That game gets pretty hard as you go... like when I started we were almost disappointed about how easy it was, but now it's almost a major group effort to defeat the first few bosses. Some folks have already pointed this out, but at least BoCo is not a [http://www.little-gamers.com/index.php?strip_id=832 bad chalice carrier.] :)

Speaking of video games... I got into the [http://www.ryzom.com Saga of Ryzom] beta. So I poked at that for a while. I got my mage up to Magic level 10, the experience model is pretty cool. I think I like the game, but lets be honest... this is not SWG. I finally transported to the mainland off newbie island last night so I'm going to be doing some exploring. More details as I play I guess.

On the SWG front, I've almost finished leveling my character to Master Rifleman/Master Creature Handler/Ranger. I'm able to kill a lot to f big nasties on my own, once I finish CH, I'm not sure how big of stuff I'll be able to take down, we'll see... I'm starting to get bored with it again. And with the latest [http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2004-08-25 SOE debacle] I'm even less happy with the fact that I give them money every month. Basically a group of people gathered on one of the SWG servers and protested the random mass bans that went down [http://patch.starwarsgalaxies.com:7040/patch/web/swg/motd/patch_message.html last week], the CSR agents [http://www.uploadyourimages.com/img/151411screen.jpg issued threats]. (it's near the top of the big text box) So yea, drama, stupidity, draconian, and buggy after a year of playing. I love me some SWG. 

Moving on to things that do not cause me severe cranial pain. When I rebuilt [[Shiva]] a week or three ago, I had to buy a ~$10 can of compressed air. (well it was more like compressed chemicals, but whatever) 10oz, ~$10. So I'm not doing that anymore. I remembered my old boss LarryKellams was working on putting something together to let him blow out computers whenever he wanted. So I got in touch with him and he gave me instructions, I went down to Sears and found they have a $20 [http://www.sears.com/sr/javasr/product.do?BV_SessionID=@@@@0320462328.1093437421@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccddadcmgfmeglfcehgcemgdffmdflh.0&vertical=TOOL&pid=00915200000 5gal air tank], with a $20 kit of parts to convert the standard tire attachment to a blower (the kit also comes with attachments to use staple guns and the like so that's cool) so I can take this tank down to the gas station, fill it at the air pump, and go home and blow the dust out of my computers. Once I get it and get it working I'll post pics and impressions.

[[Jenn]]'s birthday is coming up on the 1st, and our anniversary is on the 5th. I'm going to try and do what I can to make it a nice anniversary/birthday for her, no details here of course since she reads this rather rabidly :)

Oh! and Paul is coming out this weekend, that will be good times :) and also *fingers crossed for Brett getting his job*

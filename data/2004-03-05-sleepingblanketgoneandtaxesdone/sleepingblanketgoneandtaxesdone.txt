# Today is the Greatest Day.

Well I don't know about the greatest day... but it's a good song. I worked my last 3rd shift last night. My new work schedule is now Sunday - Thursday 8:00am - 4:00pm I work in the WCC Machine Room cube 130.06.

I took down the sleeping bag I had over my window (to keep the daylight out while I slept) today finally. And man it's pretty scary looking... the sunlight has bleached it and the random rain water that got on it has given it this scary bleached marble look kind of... disturbing. 

I just did my taxes, I got a very nice refund. If you haven't done your taxes yet I '''''highly''''' recommend using the H&R Block free online tax forms. They will charge you $20 for filing the State form, but the process was fairly easy and straight forward.

I'll probably use some of my refund to upgrade my computer some, since I haven't upgrade my CPU / MB in a while. I think I may go 64-bit... but I'm not sure if I will yet or not. LANwar7 is coming up... I need to get something better than a AMD 1700+.

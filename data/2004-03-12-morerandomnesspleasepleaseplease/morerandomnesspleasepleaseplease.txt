# More random happenings.

I hate when I forget that I have a blog that people (don't) read. I didn't die I just had a fair amount of drama that I've been dealing with.

Monday was a fairly uneventful day. I spent the day working mostly... I got a new server from StephanieBurks, it's an Ultra5 to replace the Ultra1 I was using. So that was cool, I like computers that are faster. After work I gave MatthewOconnor a ride home, and hung out with him and JoeandAnami. We got some pizza (roma toms on one and broccoli on the other... yum) from PizzaExpress and watched a Miyazaki move called Laputa. I eventually headed home and went to sleep.

Tuesday was more work, and some climbing afterwards. I also tried an Asian Veggie Bowl from LaughingPlanet for the first time... I got the coconut curry with it... spicy... but yum.

Wednesday was lots of meetings, and drama at work. When I have a definite outcome of the drama, which I expect will affect me for a while anyway, I will post more.

Thursday was even more drama... blech. After work I went home and did some cleaning since Tim had left for the weekend.  A little bit after I got home [[Jenn]] showed up, which was very nice. WE hung out and chatted for a while.

My friend KatieSingleton was randomly in town and decided to pop by and say hello. So we all hung out and chatted for a while... Jenn unfortunately had to go get some sleep, and shortly after Katie had to head back to Evansville.

I sat down to watch RomeoandJuliet again, and my little sis showed up with her computer I built for her a while back, her power supply fan is making a noise, I'm afraid it will go out, so I'm going to replace it with a new one for her. We talked for a bit before she had to leave. Note to self: make sister borrow LostinTranslation and watch it, cause she hasn't.

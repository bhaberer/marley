# Lord of the Rings DVD SE thoughts.

So it's over, the last of the Lord of the rings movies has come and gone, and I finally got around to watching the 80 hours of extra footage that came with the extended edition.  {nid 1KT}

I really loved the care and work that went into the whole production. watching the behind the scenes stuff you can get the faintest idea of how much work people put into those films. People came to the set expecting to put in a week or 5 of work, and ended up staying in NZ for 5-7 years. I can't even fathom that. Peter Jackson spent 8 years of his life doing these movies. {nid 1KU}

Eight years. That's just mind boggling.  {nid 1KV}

If you haven't had a chance to see the extended editions, I highly recommend them, and I highly recommend the behind the scenes footage. Seeing how little of the movie was CGI was breathtaking. I was surprised how little they used CGI, and how most of it was camera tricks and slight of hand. It's selling for $80 at amazon.com right now for all three together. {nid 1KW}

The whole thing left me wondering why I got out of video editing in the first place. Probably because I never thought I could be involved in something like that. :) Ah well. {nid 1KX}

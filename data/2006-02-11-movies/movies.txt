There was also an awesome Sushi documentary, which had all sorts of great lines, but it's gone now, I hope someone re-uploads it.  {nid 223}

I've also been watching a lot of movies.  {nid 224}

'''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/ Brokeback Mountain]''' {nid 225}

:Excellent movie. Gut wrenching performances by some excellent actors.  {nid 226}
:Small warning to guys who go see it, ever semi-homophobic person you know will in fact make fun of you endlessly for seeing this movie. because they can't deal with it. Don't let it get you down. {nid 227}
::'''B''' {nid 228}

'''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376541/ Closer]''' {nid 229}

:I saw this movie a while back. I was captivated by the movie, it was like like watching someone fall off a building... you know whats going to happen... you can feel it... but there's nothing you can do to stop it. {nid 22A}
:I still after a month or so, I'm not sure if I enjoyed the movie... or if I even understand it, but I think I would recommend it. {nid 22B}
::'''B+''' {nid 22C}

'''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433383/ Good Night, and Good Luck]''' {nid 22D}

:I found this movie exceptionally executed and I was happy to see it got nominated for best picture. It deals in a very dry, very authentic way with the events around the McCarty and CBS clashes. The movie was so well done, I would at time almost swear I was watching a documentary, not a movie. {nid 22E}
: Highly, Highly recommended. {nid 22F}
::'''A''' {nid 22G}

'''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338427/ Shop Girl]''' {nid 22H}

:I watched this the other night with Jenn. I enjoy Jason Schwartzman's... unique acting so I was looking forward to this movie. Good movie, There's not a lot to say about it, it's no the best I've seen this year, but I enjoyed it.  {nid 22I}
::'''B+''' {nid 22J}

'''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364343/ The Final Cut]''' {nid 22K}

:Sci-Fi movie about a period in the future where brain implants record everything you ever see to be edited into a video eulogy when you die. Robin Williams stars as a cutter (editor) of the eulogies, who sees too much. {nid 22L}
::'''B''' {nid 22M}

'''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/ Batman Begins]''' {nid 22N}

:Best Batman Movie Ever. {nid 22O}
:Nothing more to say. {nid 22P}
::'''B-''' {nid 22Q}

# Mid-Expansion Crisis.

When games become work. 

I had gotten pretty heavy into Warcraft again, but this last week due to a combination of falling behind in my school work, and a sense of futility based on my participation in the current content I've had to reexamine a few things.

So to review:

* I'm taking summer classes, and as a result I don't have ample time to raid anymore. (My guild's raiding times are 4 hours M-Th).
* The next expansion will make the majority of the work I'm doing now meaningless, and that expansion is due in a few months.
* The guild I'm in doesn't seem to have the chops to show me anything that I've not seen already in the game, and even though they are nice guys, I can't see wasting my time in that way as a good thing.
* So, since there's no real use to my playing right now, I'm going to call it quits. I've taken up TF2 and various indie games in the meantime. oh and yea. doing my homework! :)

I may still play a bit on the weekends, but I'm done raiding for several hours a night for sure.

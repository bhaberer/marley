# Ramblings of a semi-depressed fool :P

So I guess I don't make many entries here recently... not a lot going on that is that interesting to report I guess... Night shift has really sucked the life out of what was already a pretty lame existences I had going. {nid 1OI}

But, I've done it before I can do it again. Hell Mike G. from work was on night shift for 15 years. I can hold out a few more months. Some days it's not that bad, and other days like today I'm just so tired and depressed it's hard to even muster the motivation to make myself food. (But I've been very good about that) {nid 1OJ}

Life is wonderful right now with Jenn and that cancels out my depression, and kind of leaves me in this demotivated limbo state. Where I'm not depressed as such but I have no desire to do things that normally make me happy (like biking) or things that I need to do like set up a wiki for a wedding info page. {nid 1OK}

This is made worse by the fact that I get nothing done on night shift... it's quite stupid. I get more work done in one daytime shift than I do all week on nights. {nid 1OL}

But enough about that, here is some stuff that's been going on: {nid 1OM}

* Jenn got an [http://www.nsf.gov/funding/research_edu_community.jsp NSF] Grant for her grad school work, it's an amazing thing, and I'm ever so proud of my Jenn :) {nid 1ON}
* The wedding plans are moving ahead, we've found a place, a photographer and a few other things. It's getting expensive, but I guess that's how it goes. I'm sure when we're old we'll look back and be amazed that we got married for so little, and we'll talk about the good Ole days and our Kid will roll their eyes and go play with their holograms or something. Damn Kids... {nid 1OO}
* I got to see [http://www.rustedroot.com/ Rusted Root] live up in Indy at [http://www.thevogue.ws/inside.html The Vogue].  My old friend Leslie works there so Tim and I got hooked up and got to watch the show from the sound booth. It was an excellent show, and it was cool to see Leslie again. I haven't seen her in ages. It's kind of trippy to see people you used to hang out with in High School all grown up and such. Chris Glave, another friend from High School days, was there as well... cool seeing him. {nid 1OP}
* Shiva (my main machine) had a hard drive crash the other day and I lost tons of music (My entire Electronic directory was corrupted) and a lot of misc files. It really sucked. My drive is under warranty, and so I'm waiting for a new one now. {nid 1OQ}
* My old 19" CRT Monitor is starting to make clicking death noises so I'm looking at getting a [http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/ProductDetail.aspx?sku=320-1578&c=us&l=en&cs=19&category_id=5194&first=true&page=productlisting.aspx Dell 2001FP] to replace it with. I've heard nothing but good things about them, so I'm looking forward to it. I'm waiting till it's on sale and I have the money for one, I'm waiting till it drops to about $500-$550. {nid 1OR}

That's all that really springs to my mind, I've not been up to too terribly much these days... hopefully this whole mess at work will blow over soon and I can get to repairing the damage that my usurper has done, and apologizing to the people he has angered... *sigh* {nid 1OS}

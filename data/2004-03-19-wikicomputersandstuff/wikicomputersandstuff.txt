# Wiki Fun.

I spent some time this morning filling out a little more info into the [[People]] page of the wiki. A lot of the pages have pictures now, which is cool. I'll be adding more info for people soon... I just am too lazy to deal with it.

Last night after Jenn left, Kirsten got a hold of me and whined at me for a bit until I went and fixed her computer for her. Her friend Tyler was there, it was cool to see him again. 

Today at work has been rather dull... I have a 2 hour orientation meeting at 1pm that is going to be horrible.

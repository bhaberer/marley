# Yay!

Today was a nice day.

Today was a nice day.

I went around noon to get some food and sign the paperwork for the car loan. I had some quiznos for lunch (mmmm... raspberry chipotle sauce). And, I dropped the car off at Honda to have them check it out. While I waited I read through the second MegaTokyo book that I ordered from ThinkGeek the other day.

Honda gave me a thumbs up and I went and snagged a cashiers check for the car, and went by borders to get the newest ThirdEyeBlind CD.  I bought the car and spent like an hour cleaning shit out of my old car. I haven't decided what's going to happen to old [[misty]] yet, I am thinking about giving it away to someone who wants to make the needed repairs or selling it to someone who will part it out. Not sure.

After all that I dropped by LaughingPlanet and got some dinner before I headed over to KarenL's place to work on her DVD player.

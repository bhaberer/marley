# St. Patricks Day

This week has been an ok week. Not a lot going on, but that's not too bad of a thing.

[[Jenn]] and I went climbing today, it was her first time. She did pretty good, and went up a few times and belayed me a few times. She was pretty nervous, but she kicked some ass. She says she wants to go again sometime, so that's something to look forward to. :)

It's St. Patricks day, and Jenn is heading off to hang out with a group of friends, and I'm not sure what I'm doing yet.

# On Percieved Fame.

When making it big doesn't mean you can quit your day job.

I went and saw Mock Orange in concert on Friday. Tim even came down and we made a night of things, which was nice as we've not had a lot of time to hang out recently. 

We ended up at Bears a little early, but the show soon got going. The mixing on the board wasn't particularly great, but the music was excellent. First band was blah. By that I mean that they were perfectly decent, don't get me wrong, it wasn't like a Gwar cover band or anything. 

Mock Orange went second, and gave an excellent performance, as always. It's weird, they have this kind of mass following in Japan, and even held the top slot in the indie charts over there, but here they remain fairly unknown. They had like 20-30 people show up at bears, and when you compare that to their Japan shows it's just crazy.

I'm not sure why they haven't had the same luck here as they have in Japan, I'm happy to blame the RIAA music complex, but I don't really know anything about it. I find it kind of depressing that you can have four albums out, and have tours going in Japan / Europe, but when you get home you're stuck playing bars and coffee houses cause you didn't want to sell your soul to the RIAA. 

After the show Zach and his wife came and sat with us to watch the third band. When I deal with Zach it's always a little weird. We used to have a much more hostile relationship, but since graduating we've been fairly cool with one another, while not actually being active friends or anything. 

Sitting next to three people I went to high school with for first time in a long, long time was a bit of a trip. I have kind of made a point of avoiding as many people from Harrison as I am able. Mainly because of the rampant homo/xenophobic and evangelistic tendencies that were present in that school, but more because that's a part of my life I wasn't particularly happy about (Save for the technical theater work I did, that was fun, and the people tended to be cool). 

I felt like I had a point when I started this entry but it's gone now... It was good hanging out with Tim, weird seeing people from high school, and depressing seeing the lackluster reception of Mock Orange... that's about it.

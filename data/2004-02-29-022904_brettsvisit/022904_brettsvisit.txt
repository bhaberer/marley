# Brett Came a Callin'

BrettSmith came and stayed the weekend. It was good times.

BrettSmith came and stayed the weekend. It was good times.

He came over around 7-8pm on Friday. I was just about to sit down and watch Romeo and Juliet, the newest addition to my MovieCollection (side note, I added a list of DVDs and VHS movies I own to my wiki). Since Brett hadn't seen it we watched it, I really love that play and that movie. We ordered some pizza from Avers and played some Final Fantasy.

The next morning after I came home from work we went and grabbed some breakfast at the Village Deli. Yummy. After that we came home and I took a nap for a while. When I woke up we got a call from Mom and Jan who were coming into town, we hooked up with them and went and had dinner at Little Tibet... I love that Place. I got a plate of dumplings (half veggie and half chicken). After that Mom and Jan headed home and we invited BoCo over to play some Final Fantasy. We played for a couple hours and then it was time for me to goto work again.

Today I woke up around noon and Brett and I headed up to Indy to pickup my little sister KirstenHaberer. We then drove back to Bloomington (not before the chai I forgot about on top of my car spilled and ran all over the car).
We were planning on going to Bears later with JoeBlaylock, AnamiSheppard, MatthewOconnor, BethM and maybe BoCo and KirstenHaberer. Alas because of the Oscars there was no simpsons, so instead we got an EvesGarden and watched cartoons (Daria, Simpsons, and South Park). Joe and Anami came over after a bit to hang out.

Good Times.

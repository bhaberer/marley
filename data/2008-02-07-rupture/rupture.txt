# Rupture

Short entry about the Rupture service.

Rupture is a company that runs a gaming aggregation site. I've been beta testing the service since it debuted, mostly because the mash-up of social software and video games makes me giddy.

The company was started by Shawn Fanning of Napster and SnoCap fame. Their first incarnation was simply a Worldof Warcraft social networking site. However, with the advent of the Armory their web 2.0 societal niche was co-opted! Never one to give up on an idea, they revamped the service, made it game agnostic and relaunched the site as less of a social network, and more of a front end for displaying all the gaming data event points in your online life.

Currently, the site is still in heavy beta, but they currently support:

* Steam Accounts
* World of Warcraft Characters
* XBL Accounts
* Halo3 Accounts

If anyone is interested in getting in on the beta, let me know.

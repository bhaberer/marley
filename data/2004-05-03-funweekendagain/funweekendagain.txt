# Yay for the weekend... too bad it's over.

On Friday [[Jenn]] and I went to a party for her work place. It was a lot of fun. I made Pasta Salad (PastaSaladRecipe), which turned out good I think. I got to meet Jenn's co workers and boss, they all seemed pretty cool. :)

Saturday we bummed around for a while and went out to eat lunch at Lennie's Yum. After that [[Jenn]] dragged me to her gym since I've been dragging her to the climbing gym so much :) After sweating for a while in the HPER (ow, sore) We headed home.

I also finished setting up her computer for her finally, and I set it up at her place on Saturday... I'm glad she has a nice machine to work with now. Her laptop was causing her much pain.

Sunday was fun, we went to Bears and met up with JoeandAnami for simpsons and fries eating goodness. I think we're going to try and hang out with them sometime this week so [[Jenn]] can learn how to play settlers of catan.

Good vibes to BoCo, JoeBlaylock, TimCarper, and anyone else who has finals this week.

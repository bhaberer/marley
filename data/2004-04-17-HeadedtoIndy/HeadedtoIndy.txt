# Yay for Indy.

[[Jenn]] and I got up today and we headed on into the prompt care center and got some medicines to help us feel less pathetic. We ran a few errands after that and headed on up to Indy for a few hours.

I wanted a watch from the [http://www.fossil.com Fossil Store] and [[Jenn]] needed more makeup and stuff, so we went and had a wonderfully nice car ride up and back. I found a wonderful watch, and Jenn got some cute clothes :) Good Times.

Oh, and the pictures from the cascades are up here: http://weirdo513.org/gallery/album19

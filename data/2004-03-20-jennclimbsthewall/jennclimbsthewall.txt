# Jenn Climbs!

Last night after work [[Jenn]] and I went out to see "Starsky and Hutch", which ended up not being too bad of a film actually. We headed home and watched some King of the Hill.

Last night after work [[Jenn]] and I went out to see "Starsky and Hutch", which ended up not being too bad of a film actually. We headed home and watched some King of the Hill.

In the morning we (I say we like I was any help :P) made some yummy breakfast and then I gave her some help with finishing up the last of her taxes. After that we went climbing again.. it was a lot of fun, Jenn finished her first route! I was happy for her, she did a 5.7. I worked on a couple 5.8/7s for a while before we had to leave.

[[Jenn]] went to help out at the soup kitchen for a few hours and my Mom (SusanThomas) came up to see me and my sister (KirstenHaberer). We all went to the TrojanHorse for lunch. It was a lot of fun, it was nice to see her again.

Later on Jenn and I went for a second run at the gym. She climbed a few more routes, and just went up a couple wall, and basically kicked ass for her second day climbing. I was pretty impressed. :)

Now I'm getting ready to have a small dinner of some corn and maybe some soup... and then hit the hay... work tomorrow... blech.

# Weekend Fun.

Friday is one of my days off now, I have a Friday-Saturday weekend which is better but still not normal. I spent some of the day shopping, getting some food and a few new clothes. So that was good. 

Friday is one of my days off now, I have a Friday-Saturday weekend which is better but still not normal. I spent some of the day shopping, getting some food and a few new clothes. So that was good.

Friday night I had the pleasure of seeing [[Jenn]] again. We went to Lennies to have some dinner, and then went to the [[Cinomat]] and rented [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239986/ Sidewalks of New York]. The movie was pretty excellent, I recommend it. 

Today I woke up and did some laundry and a little cleaning to maintain some level of sanity.  Then I went with [[Jenn]] to the climbing gym to show her around. I'm trying to manipulate her into coming to climb with me sometime soon. *Maniacal Laughter* I really think she'll like it. After that, we went to lunch and ran some errands with her, it was a lot of fun. :) 

Now I'm home being a dork. I'm back reading The Blind Watchmaker again, I swear I'll finish it one day. And just hanging out for the evening... probably goto sleep here in a bit.

Hope everyone's having a good weekend, I certainly did.

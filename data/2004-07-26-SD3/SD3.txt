# San Diego - Day 3

We woke up today and headed over to the bay to meet up with Loni Jenn's Dad, Loni's twin sister Lori and Lori's husband. 

We woke up today and headed over to the bay to meet up with Loni Jenn's Dad, Loni's twin sister Lori and Lori's husband.  We trekked over to this small island in the bay area where Jenn's father had set up camp on a picnic table overlooking the water.

We got there and hung out for a while. Some of the people wanted to go for a bike ride, and so Jenn's Dad let me borrow his Trek and go biking with the rest of them. His bike is a nice Trek bike and remarkably similar to what I want to get soon, and I think I really like the bike so I'm even more excited about getting one now :) The biking group wandered through the Island area and then over to a neat resort hotel on the other side of the island, it was pretty beautiful, after we scoped out the resort a bit we headed back.

We got back to where Jenn and her Dad were and I laid down with Jenn and read a bit of [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/156898457X/103-0973926-8175062?v=glance Empire: Nozone IX] (which is pretty cool,  Thanks Karen! :) ) After a while Jenn's Dad got out the burgers and started cooking. These massive behemoth burgers were no less than an inch thick and six inches wide. Solid almost-sirloin quality burger marinaded in Loni's special sauce, and then cooked to perfection, I've not had a burger this good (or big!) for a long long time... if ever... I feel like homer thinking about it... mmmm....burger... hehe. We also had this odd, yet incredibly yummy bean dish that is a family specialty evidently, as well as some potato salad and the normal assortment of chips and what have you. I was so full after lunch, so we skipped dinner for the most part.

We headed home from the beach and took showers and Jenn and I decided to go see [http://www.supersizeme.com Super size Me!] a documentary about the guy who went on the all McDonald's diet and almost killed himself. It was disturbing to say the least. Jenn had to leave near the end she was feeling sick, and frankly I was as well. After the movie was done we headed home for the night. I journaled for a while and Jenn talked with her Dad. All in all a great day.

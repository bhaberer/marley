# Valentines Day and Loose Change.

[[Jenn]] and I spent the evening together. We made Veggie Lasagna from a [http://jrbl.livejournal.com/6775.html recipe I got from] JoeBlaylock. It ended up pretty good, we threw in some squash, which was yummy, yummy. We also melted some chocolate and made some chocolate covered strawberries. We sat and cuddled and watched [http://imdb.com/title/tt0061722/ The Graduate], which Jenn had never seen all the way through.  {nid 23A}

Tomorrow I have a Logic Midterm. I'm a little worried, but I seem to have figured out the main stuff that was causing me trouble. I got my Stats Exam back that I took a week or so ago, and I got a 116% on it... So that rules. {nid 23B}

Last but not least... If you haven't heard of, or seen "Loose Change", I highly recommend it. You can view it here: [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5137581991288263801 On Google Video]. It's about 9/11. It's fairly mind blowing. I plan on acquiring a hard copy of this documentary eventually. {nid 23C}

I mean... Just wow. This little video has me pretty speechless. I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 and I was like OK... some good information... but fairly propaganda laiden, can't take this too seriously. But this movie addresses some of the logistical questions I had on 9/11. Worth a watch even if you think it's crazy. Small note the movie is 1:21 {nid 23D}

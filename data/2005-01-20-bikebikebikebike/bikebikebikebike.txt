# Yay.

Got a call from the bike shop, they got my bike in yesterday and helpfully have it together and such. I want to go test ride it after work and maybe buy it as well. :) So that will be good. The only bad part is that it will be like -80 for the next week or three so I won't get much riding done. Riding in the cold after you're used to riding in the cold is not that bad but getting back in the swing of riding while it's -1C out is not a great idea. But I'll probably ride a bit tomorrow, cause I'm a nut.  {nid 1L0}

So now have an extra Trek... my Trek 820/880 is about 8-10 years old, steel frame, 21 speed grip shift mountain bike... it's a bit old and a might heavy, and I've put it through hell. But, it works and I'm not asking much. The brake pads need to be replaced, and I would subtract that work and any other critical maintenance from the total cost of the bike, if anyone is interested send me a note at my gmail address, username at gmail is bhaberer. {nid 1L1}

I <3 [http://www.japanesesnacks.com/newjs.php?id=121 Ramune soda] :) Saraga has a sale on Ramune (or did last time I was there) and I got a 6 pack. I also got some dumplings that I've been steaming in our rice cooker. The chicken ones I got are great, the veggie ones are a bit off, but I'm gonna try a different brand next time. I really like Saraga, I should go there more.  {nid 1L2}

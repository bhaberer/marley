# I'm such a journaling slacker!

I am horrible, it's been like three weeks since my last useful post. So lets see what have I been up to... {nid 1IX}

Well, a few weekends ago I went to a Halloween party of someone [[Jenn]] knows from work/school. It was good times. They had their house all done up with political horror. Which was not that far from reality, since Bush had just won the election and all. They had stuff like "four more years!" written everywhere and a place to sign your very own loyalty oath. It was really scary. :) Oh, and there's finally a picture of us in costume... {nid 1IY}

We're so going to hell, but oh well. The next weekend [[Jenn]]'s mom came up from Texas. It was cool seeing her again. TimCarper also came down from Indy to hang out for the weekend. There was a lot of WoW for Tim and I, and a lot of decorating and mother daughter stuff for [[Jenn]] and her mom. Later on there was dinner with [[Jenn]], her mom, BrettSmith, TimCarper and myself. We went to gratzi which was very yummy. On Monday Mom and Jan came up from Evansville to see [[Jenn]]'s Mom, we went out to The Siam House. Which was also veeeeery good.  {nid 1J0}

So that was fun, I hope [[Jenn]]'s mother gets to come up again soon, though I assume the next time I'll see her is when we see her for Christmas. Speaking of which I'll be going down to Evansville for Thanksgiving, and I'll be heading down to Florida to spend the days leading up to Christmas with [[Jenn]]'s mom and family. I might try and head down to Evansville maybe for the weekend before Christmas, or something but I havn't decided yet. Rumor has it Thom might be coming home for te holidays, not sure if he'll be alone or not yet.  {nid 1J1}

Hmmmm... what else. Oh yea, we went to Oliver a few days ago to get some wine to bring to Thanksgiving (the people who are throwing the shindig like Oliver Wine) and we discovered our favorite wine (Muskat Caneli) and they also sold out of Blackberry (which I really liked!) So I went on a hunt around town for more Muskat, and found a couple bottles at Bloomingfoods. So, now we have a few bottles to open on special occasions. :) I also have a bottle of Cherry I finally opened last night that ended up being really nice. Not something I want to buy every time, but a good once in a while thing.  {nid 1J2}

[[Jenn]] and I are doing great. Grad school is sucking her will to live, and third shift is crushing mine, but otherwise we are doing good. :) I get to move to her place in about a month and I can't wait... I love her so much. Tonight she is coming over for dinner and stuff, good times. {nid 1J4}

This post also serves as due notice that I will cease to exist for the next few days, weeks, etc. as WoW comes out today, and I'm hopelessly addicted, only a few things, like work, sleep and [[Jenn]] have any chance of prying me from it for the next while :) You've been warned!  {nid 1J5}

For those who care, here are some pics from my WoW fun so far: {nid 1J6}

# Sol seems to be working.

I have KDE running on it for now, but with word that I have a better machine on the way I'm reticent to install anything else on the machine at this point. {nid C9}

I'm at work right now, I'm studying Solaris documentation and organizing my cubicles, since this is a HoteledCubicle I'm having to coexist with two other guys (the 2nd and 3rd shift supervisors). So I got permission to play archeologist and rummage through the storage cabinet here in my cube and toss, organize, and move the stuff inside.  {nid CA}

Things found: {nid CB}

* 10-15 10mbs Ethernet cards with an interface that looks kind of like AGP. {nid CC}
* 20+ Printer cables. {nid CD}
* 2 hard drives less than 200mb in size. {nid CE}
* 6 New Computer Kits from Dell or Gateway {nid CF}
* 10 1mb Macintosh Simms {nid CG}
* 3 modems, on 33.6 kbps and two 2400 bps. {nid CH}
* One External Ethernet to serial interface. {nid CI}
* Uncountable Manuals for systems, software, or hardware we don't have anymore. {nid CJ}
* 4 manuals for things we still have. {nid CK}
* 60-70 backup 3.25" Disks {nid CL}
* 30 Power Cables {nid CM}

But I cleaned all that out and moved it to the other cube... well some of it... most of it I moved to the trash can. I went out and got some random office supplies and I feel very spiffy and organized. {nid CN}

I think we're rolling out a new system on Thursday so I'm going to try and be here for that. I start Sunday... sweet. {nid CO}

I'm going to a math lecture tonight with my friend Jenn, it's called [http://www.indiana.edu/~deanfac/patten/diaconis_patten.htm On Consequences] and it looks very interesting.  {nid CQ}

# My birthday!

My birthday is coming up next weekend and I'll be wandering the Bloomington bars becoming inebriated and having fun. Any and all are welcome to join, drinking is not a requirement, but having fun is required. {nid 1RQ}

We'll probably be starting the night at the Jungle Room on Kirkwood around 9:00 and migrate as we see fit. Probable migration targets include, but are not limited to Irish Lion, Bears, Crazyhorse, Bullwinkle's, Bluebird, and Nicks. {nid 1RR}

You can IM me (weirdo513 as always) for my cell if you plan on catching up at some point.  {nid 1RS}

# It's raining, how nice. 

Even though it's a bit too cool for my tastes I have the window open so I can hear the rain while I sit here and read and try to stay warm... *shiver*  But, at least it's not snowing... again.

Yesterday was a long day. I spent the day working on updating the master list of servers we backup at work cross referencing the lists on 4 different machines. Lots of fun, I think I'm just about done, I'll probably finish when I go in on Sunday. I also had to spend an hour or so pulling tape numbers... fun times.

After work I fucked around playing Unreal and BF:Vietnam some; later on I went and went with [[Jenn]] to do some shopping which was actually a lot of fun. She then went with a couple friends from work to go hang out for a while, I got to meet Jackson, one of the Grad students from the Lab. After the bar 'fun' she came by and visited for a while before I had to take her home home so she could go to sleep... not all of us are on freaky Sun-Thurs schedules. :)

I came home to find that TimCarper and BoCo were going to go get Tim's car that got towed earlier in the week. So, after I grabbed a few things that I missed from the store earlier (Juice and Stir-fry sauce) We went and abducted BoCo. I'm not sure why Tim didn't just ask me... *shrug* 

After they got home we watched some simpsons and I made them some noodles and corn.  I've found that "House of Sang" Stir-Fry sauce makes an excellent sauce for plain noodles. So I got a couple new flavors last night, both of which are bit spicy for me, but [[Capsaicin]] is good for you even if it makes me want to die... right? Right.

Oh yea, both MelissaK and ThomHaberer sent me e-mails in the past week... not sure what's got them all stirred up, I'll deal with that sooner or later I guess. {nid ID}

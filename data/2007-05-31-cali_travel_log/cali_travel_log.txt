# California Travel Log

Spending our first anniversary in California.

This is a long entry littered with pictures, it's a general travel log of my short visit to Southern California in May of 2007. I saved it up because I wanted to add a bunch of pictures once I got home. I then got very busy and didn't get to post it until now, making it far less relevent and interesting, but c'est la vie. 

Day 1 - San Diego, CA
---------------------

We arrived at the San Diego airport around 5:30. Got our bags and caught a bus to Avis. Picked up a Chevy HHR which is kind of this annoying wannabe PT Cruiser.

We grabbed some Asian food from a place in El Cajon, it was pretty decent, but not my favorite. We took the food up to Jenn's father's place in Crest to eat it with them. We had a nice meal with them and then Jenn's father showed me the finished touches he's been doing on his house. He's been rebuilding his house from scratch after the fire of 2003 (that wiped out large swaths of the San Diego area) burned it to the ground. After dinner we headed down to our motel, stopping on the way for some basic provisions for breakfast. We checked into the hotel and I played some Elite Beat Agents while Jenn watched five different channels at once (she's really been missing cable) and finally settled on some weird HBO show about polygamy. 

Day 2 - Claremont, CA; Upland, CA; Anaheim, CA
----------------------------------------------

We started off the day late, sleeping in till about 10 or so (Jenn was up at 7:30 cause she's a freak). We packed up and checked out of the motel. We ran by Larry's (father in law) plumbing store in La Mesa because I've never seen it. After a quick tour of the shop and a free grapefruit (don't ask) we headed up to Claremont.

We got to Claremont mid-day, and we took a tour of Pomona college, which was pretty cool. It was kind of a weird feeling place, everything was open air and a newly built feeling. It sort of reminded me of a college combined with a tropical resort. However, I was severely disappointed that it looked nothing like the campus in Real Genius. (Real Genius was shot at Pomona, but I'm only kidding.) We visited with an old professor of hers who taunted me with a Japanese puzzle box, and frightened Jenn with a flying monkey. After that we set off in search of some wireless, but it seems that wireless everywhere is not a reality in California like it is in Bloomington, something I found mildly shocking. The only place we found that even offered wireless was Starbucks, and they were charging a premium to connect. Free wireless would make me want to buy stuff and hang around, but instead we just left. Feeling dejected we stopped by a restaurant Jenn used to like, but their service was poor so we left there as well... stupid Claremont people are too good for us! I kid, I kid. After we left the restaurant we decided that it was high time for some In-n-out, and so off we rode and I got me some double-double love.

In-n-out is by far the most consistently excellent fast food I've ever had. (Backyard burger comes in a very close second only because they use Black Angus and In-n-out does not.) Damn that place is delicious, glad we don't have them in Indiana, that would be bad news for my already robust waistline. Jenn got herself a grilled cheese, which is something off of In-n-out's notorious secret menu.

After In-n-out Jenn went to the mall and did some shopping. I looked bored and played my DS. We left the mall and headed down to Upland, CA. Jenn had an appointment with the guy who did her tattoo seven years ago. She had noticed it had started to fade, so she wanted to get it touched up. We spent a long time waiting for the guy, but he seemed to do an excellent retouch of the original tattoo. I saw a shirt with a stylized dragon on one side that I liked a lot, so I snagged a souvenir. I think it's pretty cool, and Jenn doesn't hate it, so go me. After all that we headed to Anaheim to check into our Disneyland adjacent hotel. Long day, gonna go sleep. 

Day 3 – Costa Mesa, CA; Brentwood, CA; Culver City, CA; Santa Monica, CA
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Started off the day at a early 10am, to the sounds of brats playing outside our room. We got up slowly and headed down to Costa Mesa to the South Coast Plaza, a huge upscale mall near Irvine, CA. We went there to visit Greg, a friend of mine who I have played WoW with for a couple years. We stopped by Banana republic and said hi, he was swamped so we didn't get to visit for very long. 

Jenn decided that she hadn't thought out the whole tattoo retouching thing very well, since she had only brought tight jeans, and since you are supposed to let fresh tattoos breath and you know, generally avoid rubbing them with harsh denim all day long. So we ducked into Nordstrom's and picked her up a skirt and grabbed some lunch in their cafe which was surprisingly tasty. 

After that we head out to Brentwood to meet up with Jenn's friend Pascal. We finally found his apartment and caught a ride in is sexy new 2007 BMW 335i. While not a car I would probably ever want to own, it was really nice. We drove off to Culver City for some sushi that Pascal insisted was amazing. We pulled into this semi-sketchy part of town and parked the car, we got to sit down immediately, in a place that looked like an authentic (as opposed to showy trendy sushi place) sushi-ya and I was excited. On Pascal's recommendation I got a sashimi sampler with teryaki chicken, as well as an order of Bluefin Tuna sashimi and a "Sakura Roll" which ended up being tuna, avocado, some kind of shrimp mix, with salmon covering the top. The roll was amazingly good, and the tuna was some of the best tuna I've ever had. Granted I don't tend to ever order nice tuna, since I don't normally like the normal tuna sashimi. My sashimi sampler was nothing amazing, but it was all consistently well cut fresh and full of flavor, something that can't be said for most places I get sashimi.

Stuffed good and well from sushi, we hopped in the car and headed down to the Santa Monica pier. We wandered down the pier a bit and Pascal and I ducked into an ice cream place talking excitedly about Sun River, OR a place that I used to spend summers, and where Pascal had been several times. We paused and noticed Jenn had vanished, we dashed outside to find an unexpected sight. There was Jenn standing dumbstruck next to this woman with a leashed cat... on her shoulder. And if that's not enough to make you snicker evidently Jenn had asked to pet the cat and the lady had launched into some nonsensical tirade about cats and and buffalo and aquamarine watermelons that were trying to eat her brain. Jenn declares "She's nuts!" and walks away, causing the crazy parrot-cat lady to start pointing at Jenn and yelling about her lavender spandex monkeys and the bad men in her toe nails. We finally got some ice cream and sat next to the water eating it, Pascal asked Jenn if she could take a guess as to why he didn't come down there often, and I was able to give her a hint. As we headed back to the car we noticed the crazy lady had found a new victim and was discussing the best ways to inflate butcher knifes with him. He seemed to be less than intrigued.

We headed home, and when we got near Disney, we noticed the nightly fireworks were going on. They seem to shoot them over the highway which seemed to me like a good recipe for pileups, but whatever. We're back at the hotel now, and Jenn's already passed out, the poor thing. I should probably head that way as well seeing as we're getting up at like 6:30 tomorrow to hop a bus to be at Disney land the instant it opens.

Day 3 – Anaheim, CA (ZOMG DISNEYLAND)
-------------------------------------

http://gallery.weirdo513.org/d/9302-1/2007+trip_02<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/weirdo513/1795814192/" title="Haunted Mansion by weirdo513, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2078/1795814192_0f78433860.jpg" width="500" height="376" alt="Haunted Mansion"></a>

So we got up at 6:30 and hopped a bus to Disneyland. We got there before anything was open, and got in line to wait for the park to open at 8:00am. It was nice getting there early because after they threw the gates open we had about two hours of rides before there were noticeable lines anywhere. 

(Note: Forgive the liberal use of "Then we"'s, it was a long day and I was not feeling particularly poetic... )

First, we sprinted to space mountain and got in like the third car ride of the day, it was a pretty sweet ride, and holds up a lot better than a lot of the other Disney coasters. After we got out of Space Mountain we dashed over to the Matterhorn, and rode it quick. After that we headed over and rode Small World because we didn't want to stand in line for something that lame later. Then we headed to the Star Wars ride (Star Tours) and listened to bad droid acting. After our very near death encounter with the death star (oh no!) we decided to take a breather and take a jungle cruise, little did we know of the bad puns and almost lifelike animals that awaited us! The Horror! Then we were off to the Pirates of the Caribbean, which was pretty cool, except that they have replaced the old capt jack sparrow with a really lifelike Depp robot, but all the other robots are still the almost cartoony pirates they always have been, so he's really out of place. After we dealt with the pirate invasion, we moved onto the Haunted Mansion, which was pretty cool, what with the holographic ghosts in the car and all. 

When we left the Mansion we noticed the new Winnie the Pooh ride, and being the geeks we are, we had to get in line. It was pretty cute. Then we walked over and got in line for thunder mountain railroad, which was pretty fun. Then we went and got in line for space mountain again, this time there was a line and we ended up being in line for about 35-40 minutes. But this time riding it was much better for some reason. Then we found a Mexican place for some alright lunch, but it was a restaurant in an amusement park so what can you really expect. 

When we rode on Thunder Mountain Railroad we had noticed people had birthday buttons on so Jenn made me go get one, and they also gave us some anniversary buttons, so I looked like a goofball. Then we went to the teacups, which were a lot of fun, I think I almost made Jenn puke. Then we went and tried on goofy Disney hats, but not an actual goofy hat. Then we went on Mr. toads wild ride. Then we went and headed to get pictures taken with Pooh, but we noticed that they had fixed Indiana Jones, so we went on that quick. Then we got pictures of us with Winnie! Good times. We headed home after that because we were loosing steam after 9 hours of Disneyland walking. 

We relaxed at the hotel for a few hours and then ordered some of the most expensive papa johns ever! We ate it and watched the last part of Return of the King on TV. At 9:30 we walked out on the balcony outside our room and watched the Disneyland fireworks with Jenn in my arms. All in all not too shabby of an anniversary... :)

Day 4 – San Diego, CA
---------------------

Monday was a fairly relaxing day. Jenn and I slept in until about 10-11 and then got up to pack up so we could check out of our room by 12:00. We headed back down to San Diego and got there mid afternoon. We decided to stay at Jenn's father's place after recalling the sketchiness of the Motel 6 in El Cajon.

We relaxed for a little bit and I discovered that Larry's Wireless cloud had died sometime over the past couple weeks, I spent some time working on getting it fixed with little in the way of results.

We then went out for dinner at a decent Mexican place in old town, and then came back and relaxed a bit. However a little while later Jenn got a little stir-crazy and so we headed down to Hooley's, a decent little Irish pub. It seems to be a little too much restaurant for my tastes but they had a semi-decent Heffe (Widmer) and a very nice cider (Woodpecker or better, hard to tell). Jenn got some ice cream in the form of Strawberry shortcake, and I started to get some heartburn, which is rare for me. It got so bad that we headed home, abandoning my precious cider... *sniff*

Day 5 – San Diego, CA
---------------------

Another nice leisurely day. We woke up late and plodded around the house. Jenn dropped me off at my brother's apartment, and we had some time to hang out, which was nice. We went and grabbed some L&L's Hawaiin BBQ. Intense meat consumption has become a theme for this vacation I fear. So I had a BBQ "Mix" that included some pork, beef and chicken, it was pretty tasty for take out BBQ.

After I got back from my brother's place Jenn had to go to another appointment, and then she went out with her girlfriends for a little girls night out. I had dinner with Larry and Loni, and Larry made me some of the best BBQ chicken I have had in a very long time. Larry gave me a bottle of wine and we talked for about an hour or two on various topics, it was an alright evening. Jenn came home and joined in on the discussion, making fun of how inebriated I was after a bottle of Merlot. 

I also related my problems with the wireless to Larry who immediately was all about getting a new AP, I calmed him down and said I would look at it the next day and let him know how things looked.

Day 6 – San Diego, CA
---------------------

Woke up at 4am with a splitting headache and no desire to sleep anymore. I think I remember now why I only sleep 5-6 hours a night. It's all I need and when I sleep too much I wake up in the middle of the night wide awake with a headache. Strange. I wandered upstairs to get some water and relax a bit before trying to go back to bed. I found Larry and Loni already up. I sat down and drank my water on the couch while Larry watched TV. It was mildly surreal. I eventually made my way back to bed and with some difficulty I went back to sleep.

I woke up around 10 and got up this time. I snuck some leftover BBQ chicken for my breakfast, and then looked into the router. The wireless seemed shot even after a reset I couldn't get any kind of signal from the AP, so I told Larry to get a new one and when he brought it home we set it up and it works like a charm.

Jenn and I were going to go see a movie, but with the best thing available being "hog wild" we opted to watch "This film is not yet rated" on my laptop together in our bed. After we finished the movie we went out to get a bite at Inn-n-Out, and pop by the El Cajon animal shelter. We found some cuties including some Siamese kitties, and a Siberian husky.

Headed back to the house and after some puttering around had some burgers (remember what I said about the mass meat consumption?) with the family. After dinner Jenn and I went to visit her friend's new house (they just finished their rebuild after the 2003 fire) and get a tour. It was a really nice house, I dug it. And Jenn's friend's family is really quite awesome. Good people.

We headed back and hung out at the house for a bit, Loni made some yummy warmed fruit over vanilla ice cream concoction that I found quite tasty. Mmmmm.... warmed fruit over ice cream concoction. 

The next day we headed back home, not a bad trip.

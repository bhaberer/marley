# WebComics and Good Days make me happy :)

Yesterday was a nice day. I woke up next to a beautiful woman.

Yesterday was a nice day. I woke up next to a beautiful woman. (Just don't tell [[Jenn]] hahaha! I'm so funny.) Then [[Jenn]] and I went to the Farmers Market, and got some random veggies. I got a half pound of shiitake mushrooms, and some tomatoes from the Meninites. Then I took Jenn home and I went back to my apartment, BrettSmith and I made a yummy Mushroom Stir-Fry (1c Portabello, 1c Yellow Tomatoes, 1c shiitake, 1c Baby Bella, couple hand fulls spinach) it turned out rather good. Then I played SWG: Jump to Lightspeed for a while. In the evening [[Jenn]] and I went out to Yogi's for a while. (I'm not a big fan of Yogi's it's too smoky and loud... I don't like yelling to make myself heard.) We met up with some of Jenn's grad school friends and there was drinking and Pool playing and such... good times. After that I went to work, at work I got dinner and got a free extra pizza, so that ruled. It's always a good day when you get free pizza I always say! 

'''Web Comics''' 

A few people have asked in passing what comics I read, so since I have nothing else to drone on about, I'll babble on about comics... yay. So here's a list in the order I like them more or less, and a short description.

I'll have the list up later on tonight... tho I did get a start on it: ComicsIRead.

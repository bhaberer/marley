# Hanging with Jenn.

I had an excellent weekend, I spent my first Friday off working on random stuff. I was planning on maybe heading over to a StormChasers class that MikeGalloway had invited me to come to when we were at the EmergencyActionCommitee last week, but random stuff came up and I spent most of the time hanging out with TimCarper and bumming around the apartment.

I had an excellent weekend, I spent my first Friday off working on random stuff. I was planning on maybe heading over to a StormChasers class that MikeGalloway had invited me to come to when we were at the EmergencyActionCommitee last week, but random stuff came up and I spent most of the time hanging out with TimCarper and bumming around the apartment.

Later that evening I had the pleasure of being able to hang out with [[Jenn]]. It was good times, I went over and we watched LostinTranslation and I got to meet her very cool cat Cleo.

Yesterday I spent a while cleaning the apartment, and got some good work done. JessSowers showed up and that was interesting. They went and rented some DVDs and I made some lunch of some Udon and some teryaki sauce, which has become my official "I'm too lazy to make real food" meal. They brought home a couple movies and put in [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313542/ Runaway Jury] which was pretty good, I remember the book being a lot different, but it's been a while since I read a lot of John Grisham. 

I got a hold of [[Jenn]] and we went out to see MockOrange at the Second Storey. After sitting there waiting for someone to start playing we decided to jet and maybe come back later if the bands ever decided to show up. The thick smoke in the air wasn't helping us weather the wait very well so we went home and hung out for a while. Sadly, she had to go home around 12 because she needed to get some sleep for her flight today. Stupid grad school interviews. :P 

A little while after she had gone home, Timmy called and reported that MockOrange would be on "any time now" so I left after talking with the guys about randomness for a while, and got there right after they stated playing (about 4 hours after the first band was to have started playing... sheesh.) The show was pretty excellent, it was good to see Zach again.

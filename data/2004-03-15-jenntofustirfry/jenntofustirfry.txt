# Mmmmm... Tofu Stirfry....

Yesterday I worked all morning. It was one of the most boring shifts, ever. I spent most of the day waiting for 4pm to show up. I hadn't had anything new assigned to me because of the whole bumping possibility... but now that's gone away and hopefully I can get going again.

After work I went over and hung out with [[Jenn]], we ended up heading back over to my place to make some dinner. We made some stir-fry (broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, snow peas, and white & yellow tofu) and some rice. It was pretty yummy. We hung out for a while and watched Simpsons episodes and stuff.  We noticed that it had gotten late, and she needed to head home since it was way past her bed time.

A while after she left, Tim came home. He had gone and gamed with Brandon and the guys. I was headed for bed, but wasn't feeling all that tired so we ended up talking for a while before I went to bed.

Now I'm back at work again... whee.

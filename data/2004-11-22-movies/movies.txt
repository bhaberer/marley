# Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

[[Jenn]] and I rented [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/ Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind] And I really liked it. I'm a big Jim Carrey fan, and I like when he does more serious stuff like this (I liked The Majestic as well, even though no one else seems to). It's a show about Jim Carey's character deciding to have the memory of his ex girlfriend deleted after she has him deleted. I thought it was done incredibly well and it was visually stunning. I don't want to spoil it, but I recommend it, I would think that it's #35 on the IMDB top 250 for a reason after all. '''A-''' {nid 1IW}

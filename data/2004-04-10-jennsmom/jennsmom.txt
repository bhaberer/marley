# Jenn's Mom is visiting

Yesterday was a draining (cash wise) if productive day. I took the car to Sears and had them fix the alignment and put some tires on the car. While I waited I wandered down the mall and checked out a few shops.

After that I wandered over to noodle town and had some wonton soup. After that I wandered over to Borders and looked at random DVDs/Books for a while. I then headed home.

Then I went and grabbed some Eggs and Vinegar, [Jenn]] and I are planning to color Easter eggs sometime. I went home and cooked them and watched Simpsons. [[Jenn]] wandered over just as her Mom was heading into town. We went out to dinner, which was cool... [[Jenn]]'s mother is pretty neat.

Later [[Jenn]] and I went out to Upland for a while. Good Times :) 

Now I'm going to go hang out with them and search for houses and such.

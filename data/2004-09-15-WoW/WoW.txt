# World of Warcraft Brain-Dump, and other happenings. 

I've posted my [[Wowdiatribe]].

I've posted my [[Wowdiatribe]]. I wikied it since I guess a lot of you don't care at all... It's a good read I'm told. 

BoCo and friends came by and there was playing of [http://www.zelda.com/fourswords/launch/index.html The Legend of Zelda: Four Sword Adventures]. I spent the few hours we played more or less being a prick. But since I've yet to see a reason too bust my ass to win the rounds, I've been happy to set people on fire and toss them in holes... and stuff... Maybe I should [http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=105 play as red link]... or maybe not... :)

Not much else to report, I downloaded [http://www.dawnofwargame.com/ Dawn of War] today and I played it a bit before I left for work... I don't know it seems pretty cool but I haven't seen a lot that has immediately grabbed me. I'll play it a bit more tomorrow I guess. Tho I have to say that the races are lame Starcraft rip offs... I mean come on... Space Marines, Orks (evil space monsters), and Eldar (the token ancient psychic race). That's just not very original. They should just call the game "Not Starcraft 2, but we tried"... Ok I'm done being mean, I'll really try it tomorrow :)

# Salty Fishy Balls.

TimCarper called me at work and made an excellent suggestion, which was to invite JoeBlaylock and AnamiSheppard over for dinner.

After finishing up some stuff at work I headed home and picked up Timmah and we went shopping for some basic ingredients. I ended up deciding on a complex version of the standard Miso Soup, and a nice vege stir fry.  So I made some Miso soup with mushrooms, FishBalls, and YellowTofu. I also made the stirfry, and it was made up of snow peas, broccoli, tomatoes, yellow Onion, garlic, mushrooms, and various spices. I added in some nice yummy Udon noodles for a base that wasn't rice.

It came out really well. I was happy with it. We sat around and talked a lot about a lot of random things. We also watched the Raisins / Goth Kids episode of South Park cause Joe and Anami hadn't seen it. I love that episode. *tosses hair*

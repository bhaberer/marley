# Cell Phone Blues.

Well my service with Sprint PCS is coming to an end, and I'm not all that thrilled with my service so I'm looking to change. Right now the only two that look useful are ATT Wireless and verizon, and from what I hear from my friend Paul ATT is teh lose. So I'm looking at Verizon pretty much, I still need to see what plan I need and decide on a phone. Meh. I wish Sprint PCS would work but the fact that I drop calls at home fairly constantly, and that the damn phone will not even work at all when I'm at work, leaves me wanting. Sprint PCS seems to work wonders in cities that Sprint feels are worth putting up towers near. My service in Indy, Evansville and San Diego was always fine. But I live here, so no more Sprint for me.

I spent a while tonight looking over a few movies.

Some that looked at least mildly interesting:
* [http://www.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/the_final_cut/ Final Cut] - Robin Williams + Science Fiction = w00t
* [http://www.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/beyond_the_sea/ Beyond the Sea] - Not sure on this one, could be interesting, I'm a big Spacey fan.
* [http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/paper_clips.html Paper Clips] - Documentary
* [http://www.apple.com/trailers/mgm/the_yes_men/ The Yes Men] - Documentary
* [http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/lemony_snickets/ Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events] - Jim Carey's role in this looks amazing.
* [http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/kinsey/trailer/ Kinsey] - A movie about Kinsey, that should be enough.
* [http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/team_america/ Team America: World Police] - It's Trey and Matt making a movie with puppets... I don't know why I haven't gone yet :)
* [http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/the_life_aquatic/ The Life Aquatic] - Wes Anderson's latest movie, with Bill Murray. *swoon*
* [http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/asoundofthunder/ A sound of thunder] - Very cool science fiction movie.
* [http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/robots/ Robots] - This just looks hilarious.

It looks like my Neuros has been repaired and is on its way back to me, which rules. I should get it back today, so I'll have time to reload the music onto it in time for my trip down to Evansville tomorrow for my Mom's birthday. I'm going to rebuild her machine since it seems to be rapidly circling the drain... since it's almost 2 years old in a case that has no airflow, I'm not surprised. Poor Computer.

Well it's getting cold again and the [http://ct.dscp.dla.mil/Catalog/pgcs/01940.html Navy Coat] has come out again much to [[Jenn]]'s delight ;) I need a new coat though... I love this one, it's warm and water proof and long. But it's getting a bit threadbare. It's lasted four years under my hash treatment tho, so it's one hell of a coat. Hopefully I can find another long coat that can live up to this one. 

I thought I had more to report, but I'm tired now, and it's quitting time.

# Contrary to popular belief I'm alive. :) 

Sorry for the lack of updates. I suck. I've been busy this past week and a half working on a lot of things.

Sorry for the lack of updates. I suck. I've been busy this past week and a half working on a lot of things.

Last week I started my Solaris EdCert class at UITS. It went well, and kept me busy. So far it's been fairly informative. I'm looking forward to the next 2 sessions. Jenn let me borrow her laptop for work/classes and that's been a god-send. A big Jenn++ for her.

I started working a lot on my project for work. The InventoryManagementSystem is mostly done, I've got most of the underlying structure in place. I've still got lots of little tiny improvements to do, but I've done the bulk of the perl/SQL coding.

BrettSmith moved in just over a week ago. That has been going pretty good.

[[Jenn]] and I are doing well. She's getting ready to move into her happy new condo soon :) I can't wait until I'm on first shifts again so I can spend more time with my [[Jenn]]. She is the awesome. I'm so in love... yea I'm a dork... shut up. :)

I finished paying my Bloomingfoods membership stuff off. They sent me a keen certificate of Capital, and a window sticker for my car. I'm much cooler than you.

I got a few new DVDs... I know, I know... leave me alone. I got The Last Unicorn, Sneakers, The Game, and The Brotherhood of the Wolf. So that's cool.

The Cicadas are out in full force. And they seem to be good at making a lot of noise, flying into things, and getting killed by anything. I'm not very impressed by bugs that can barely fly if there is any wind blowing.... I hope they all die off soon... they annoy me.

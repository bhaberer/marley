# Geeking Out.

So, I had a good day. BUT FIRST, news.

So, I had a good day. BUT FIRST, news.

I have finally finished my [http://www.mythtv.org/ MythTV] machine. MythTV is basically a FreeSoftware TIVO. Right now I'm just testing [[Ark]] to see if the hardware is sufficient, and compatible... So far so good. I'm having a lot of fun with the software, although I'm mainly using it as a glorified mplayer box for now. It kinda looks like this:

Next month I'm going to try and find some money to get a TV Tuner card so I can start using the best parts of the software. Although the built in emulators are pretty cool.

But, anyway, on to recent events. I took a 5 day weekend over Break, I took Tues and wed nights off, as well as Saturday night. So I've been relaxing and having a nice break from working in my cube. It was also nice to spend some days with Jenn, I haven't gotten to do that much recently. I love you Jenn! <3 

Last night I went out and celebrated St. Patrick's day and had a few [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_car_bomb Car Bombs] (most politically incorrect drink name ever) and a Pint of Guinness (I got to keep my cool pint glass). Good times.

Today I got to geek out hardcore with [[Boco]] and BrettSmith. I met up with BrettSmith for lunch at SushiBar. (ImageBlog has a few pictures from lunch) The idea for a gaming/anime binge was offered up, and I accepted since I have not been able to partake in a gaming geek binge in some time.

[[Boco]] was back in town, and was convinced to partake as well. We met up at my place and played [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Four_Swords_Adventures The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures] for several hours. LoZ:FSA is a four player GameCube game where you basically play coop Zelda, it's pretty bad-ass, and you get to pick people up and toss them into lava if they piss you off!

Anyway, after that Pizza from Avers was ordered, and there was much rejoicing. While we waited for Avers Pizza, I showed Brett several episodes of this bazaar anime that [[Boco]] pointed me to... called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakitate_Japan Yakitate!! Japan]. It's an anime about a kid who makes bread. It's just awesome, and hilarious.

After pizza there was lots of NES games played. Good stuff. [[Jenn]] went to bed and I used this as a diabolical excuse to head to [[Boco]]s and play We Love Katamari and Guilty Gear. There were many good times Guilty Gear is a kick ass fighting game with a lot of weird possessed, or cross-dressing characters. There was even one who was throwing dolphins at me... fun stuff.

Now I am home, and about to head to bed... I pilfered a pile of anime from [[Boco]]. I took the boxxed set of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excel_Saga Excel Saga], boxxed set of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haibane-Renmei Haibane Renmei], the first volume of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noir_%28anime%29 Noir], and the Series [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_O The Big O] (batman, with ROBOTS!). 

Good times, great vacation. :)

# I'm a Mechanical Man.

Saturday was a good day, I got up and worked a bit on TheFrozenThrone... As of right now, I'm halfway through the Undead Campaign.

Saturday was a good day, I got up and worked a bit on TheFrozenThrone... As of right now, I'm halfway through the Undead Campaign... but I also started the bonus Orc campaign, which is very cool. The Orc campaign first mission is almost like playing WoW. The NPCs have Missions that you run for them for fun and profit. Good Times.

<Tangent>

:I had a wild idea, that will probably get me beaten savagely by [[Jenn]]. I still have the [http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000063UZ1.01.PT01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg art stills I got] from the Warcraft III: Collectors Edition, and find a four panel frame and put it somewhere... and maybe throw some game cds in there as well. That would be cool.... well ok it would be incredibly geeky, but oh well.

</tangent> 

I also helped [[Jenn]] put together her new [http://www.nordictrack.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prmenbr=153&prrfnbr=733180&cgrfnbr=46527&rootcat=46525 Nordic Track thing]... it was kind of fun. The damn thing has like 800 parts, and there was wiring, and applications of Teflon Lubricant and Grease... But, now she has an Elliptical machine that she can use everyday. :)

After I got it together we went and ran some errands and had some dinner at Asuka. I got some odd Udon soup entree that was good but probably not something I would get again. [[Jenn]] has discovered that they will make her these odd (but good) asparagus rolls with Japanese mayo inside of them... I think she's addicted.

Yesterday there was fun times going to Bears and watching Simpsons. BrettSmith and BoCo came out to hang out. There was a large amount of gaming afterwords, but [[Jenn]] in a move that conveys her intelligence opted out of that fun.

Also, after my diatribe about StarCraft I went back and spent a few hours trying to convince C&C to work with little luck. I can get Red Alert working with no sound, so that's great. But I did find a program that allows you to watch the mission videos and the intro to the game and all that good stuff... so that was pretty cool... got to relive some of the good memories. Brett just stared on with his "StarCraft was so much cooler than this crap" look on his face. But, BoCo did confirm that the C&C installer was double-plus-good. If only I could figure out how to make it work! I may just have to find an old 95 disk or something, meh.

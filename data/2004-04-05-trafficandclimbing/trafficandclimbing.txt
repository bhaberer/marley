# Traffic Notes, and Climbing Boasts.

Lunch notes. I met up with [[Jenn]] for lunch. We went to Panera (mmmm... bread bowls) and hit Kinkos and the Post Office. On our way back we got stuck behind this old guy who was going about 10-15 under the speed limit. And braked hard at every _green_ light. We were running a little late getting back from lunch and we got stuck behind him for like 4-6 blocks. How Maddening.

I also forgot to mention that we went climbing on Friday and Jenn has moved from 5.6-5.7's to solid 5.7s and was doing decently on a solid 5.8 (it's marked 5.7-5.8 but that's not very accurate.) She's kicking ass. :)

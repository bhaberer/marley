# Mmmmm... Mo Mos.

Yesterday I woke up to the sound of my phone making the "Joe/Anami is calling you" noise. I grabbed it and had an incoherent exchange with Anami about coming over and moving a tub. JoeandAnami had found a 400lb cast iron tub somewhere, and they needed help moving it.

I got up and was about to call Jenn when she knocked on the door. I conned her into coming along, and we went over to help. [[Jenn]] got to meet MikeW, and then there was much tub moving.

We left to run some errands and return for some wonderful veggie lasagna, but after running our errands we decided we were too hungry to wait for the lasagna :( So I ended up sharing an order of Mo Mos with Jenn at Little Tibet, and going home and watching Simpsons with her in my arms. GoodTimes.

I'm working on cleaning the house up and sort of delegating all of the crap Tim has at the apartment into a small area so he can come get it when he can. I think he starts his new job in Indy soon. Good luck Timmah.

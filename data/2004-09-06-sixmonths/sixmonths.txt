# Six Months! (and World of Warcraft binging)

Well it's been a whole six months since [[Jenn]] and I started dating.

Well it's been a whole six months since [[Jenn]] and I started dating. We had a nice celebration together.  I got us a room at the Hyatt in Indy to spend a night in the city. We got an awesome room on the 17th floor with a view of the Indy courthouse. [[Jenn]] has some pictures... it was pretty cool. We went out for Japanese food and then met up with TimCarper for drinks. It was GoodTimes. 

We went and saw Garden State on We3dnesday. It was very cool, I recommend it. The end credits song, "Let Go" by Frou Frou is just incredible, and I don't know why... :)

So thanks to a friend at work I got a spot in the World or Warcraft Stress Test. Rob gets mad props for giving me the spot, since they seem to have been going on eBay for upwards of $100. Yea, people are nutty.

So how does the game live up to the hype? Well I created my Night Elf druid and set out into the world, and with no prior knowledge of the game, and no manual I was able to immediately figure out 99% of what I needed to know to play the game. That's a huge plus. I hate having to read a manual to figure out what my stats do, or other such mundane information *cough*StarWarsGalaxies*cough*

Things that stick out.

* I was also immediately assaulted with content. I have things to do and a purpose in the game.
* Quests are easily findable and they are useful, and non-mandatory. Quests tell you what you'll be getting for doing the quest, and usually will offering several different rewards to better serve different classes that might be doing them.
* You have a global map that fills in with location names as you explore. And, you get exploration experience for discovering new areas. 
* Trade Skills: you can opt to use skill points to pick up stuff like weaponsmithing or fishing. I picked up herbalism and alchemy and I love making my own potions. :)
* Death system: Very cool... you die, then you have options of hunting down your corpse (in spirit form) and spawning near it at half hp/mp or spawning at the graveyard (where you go when you die) at an exp penalty (5% of your next level). 

I'll post more as I see it, one thing is for sure, I'm getting this game. :)

# Dear NOC people, and anyone else I randomly have pissed off.

Some of you took my comments this morning badly. But, this is my journal and I reserve the right to air my feelings and thoughts in any way I deem fit. However pissed off and/or exhausted dealing with a shift change, battling off a sinus infection, and two 8 hour shifts of phone calls has left me. {nid RM}

This blog is not hosted on a university computer, nor is it served on a connection paid for by the university. Therefor threats to "tattle on me" to my boss or coworkers are ridiculous, unfounded, and frankly will make you come off as rather immature. Besides, it's not even like I'm doing something as bad as [http://www.erinoconnor.org/archives/000727.html gay bashing]. {nid RN}

Granted, freedom of speech isn't what it used to be, but I still have that right to say what I want on my blog. And, it would appear that I have the universities support on that manner (strictly citing president). {nid RO}

But, with that said. I'm sorry if my comments this morning angered you to the point that you felt the need to comment. If what you're reading here pisses you off, there is a back button on your browser. I suggest you use it. {nid RP}

Thank You. {nid RQ}

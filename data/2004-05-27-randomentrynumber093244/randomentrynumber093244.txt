My Great Aunt died. :( She went to Nebraska for her 83rd birthday. and when they went to wake her up in the morning she had passed away. *sigh* It really sucks I hadn't seen her in a long time and I was hoping to see her again soon and even let her meet [[Jenn]]. My father is taking care of things right now I hope he's doing ok... 

That's all for now. I'm tired.

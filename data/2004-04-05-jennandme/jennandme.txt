# What a great weekend.

Thursday work was pretty awful. But [[Jenn]] showed up near when I was going to be leaving, we compared how crappy our days had been, and she ate some of the cookies that she made me last weekend (I had been rationing them) We headed over to the IU Surplus to check out desks and such. Afterwords she and I watched a movie called [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0220100/ Timecode] which was pretty cool, I should watch it again before I take it back.

Friday [[Jenn]] and I dropped off her car at the mechanics, and hung out for a while. It was a lot of fun, and later on we went out to Nicks and had a very nice night out. It was cool to like go out on the town and have some fun like 'normal' people. :)

The next day we went and got her car from the mechanics and dropped it off at Ziebart to get detailed (she's selling it soon). After that we went and did some shopping, I had asked Jenn to lend me a hand in finding some clothes that weren't from on-line comic strips :) After a whirlwind of shopping we went for some lunch at Penn Station. And, then we headed drove out to the TrainTressel which was really neat, we took a bunch of pictures and had a great time. Jenn even climbed to the top, which I knew was freaking her out.

That night I went and played some games with the guys at Lanwar VII, [[Jenn]] came by and witnessed the mass dorkery first hand, she's a brave, brave girl. :) She went out with a friend from work while I got my butt kicked in the finals at Battlefield 1942. After a few hours of that I went and gave her and her friend a ride home and grabbed my stuff and left the Lanwar, I just didn't have a grand amount of interest in gaming...

Sunday we went and got breakfast and did some errands all afternoon. In the evening we headed over to BearsPlace to watch simpsons and hang out with JoeandAnami, MatthewOconnor, and BethM. Good Times :)

I had a great weekend. How about you?

# Christmas! And other fun type things.

So before I get to Christmas, lets get a few random things out of the way. {nid 1JQ}

PaulVisscher had a party two weekends ago. It was good times. I drove out to Dayton with BrettSmith, and we stayed at JasonCook's place. The weekend was lots of fun, and Paul's party was a blast, it was nice hanging out with the guys. [[Jenn]] had finals to study for and was unable to go... which sucked.  {nid 1JR}

Last Thursday [[Jenn]] and I went to the Siam house with Karen. It was really nice to see Karen again. I think we're going to hang out more in the future, so that will be very cool. {nid 1JS}

On Friday BrettSmith had a potluck dinner. It was very yummy. We took bread and cheese and wine, and other people brought good food. It was very yummy and social. Go Brett.  {nid 1JT}

Saturday I went and picked up Kirsten from the airport, and then picked up Jenn and we all went down to Evansville to hang out with my family for the day. My brother came into town for a few days and it was actually nice to see him.  {nid 1JU}

And, then there's Aubrey, who got [http://star-shaped.org/2004/12/18/in-which-aubrey-gets-engaged/ engaged] the other day! That's awesome, congrats you guys. :)  {nid 1JV}

So [[Jenn]] and I had Christmas the other day. She completely kicked my ass this year. She went to my parents and got them all to pool together and they all (Jenn included) got me money to get a new bike! :) Right now I'm going between a [http://www2.trekbikes.com/Bikes/Mountain/Hardtail/Alpha_Aluminum/4500/index.php Trek 4500] with disc brakes, or a [http://www2.trekbikes.com/Bikes/Mountain/Hardtail/Alpha_Aluminum/6500/index.php Trek 6500] w/o disc brakes. I'm going to test ride them before I decide... but disc brakes seem like a good thing since I've had problems with stopping on wet/dirty/muddy brakes before which lead to me wiping out a couple times.  But, anyway :) I'm so excited :) I can't believe that [[Jenn]] pulled it this off... I love her so much. I got her a few things, the big thing was a gameboy with her own copy of Dr. Mario. She seemed pretty happy with that, I'm also going to get her a copy of super mario world. :) {nid 1JW}

That's all for now.. I'll be heading to Florida for a few days for Christmas... so if I don't get a chance to say it later, Merry Christmas to everyone. And I really should try and update this more often, with entries I don't write half asleep. That would be good. {nid 1JX}

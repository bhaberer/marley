# Heading back to Evansville.

Last night Jenn and I ended up heading over to Asuka and having edamome, some sushi, and splitting a bottle of sake. Yummy. We headed home and watched "The Life of Brian" since Jenn had never seen a Monty Python movie... what a travesty. :)

In the morning after tooling around a bit we went over to Jenn's new condo and walked though while a guy did an inspection on all the parts of the house. It was kind of interesting, although when it got to the hour and a half mark I wandered back to the car to play some WarioWare while the guy finished rooting around in the crawlspace.

We then headed down to Evansville; the ride was nice. The trees are starting to bloom and so the way down to Evansville was beautiful. Jenn took a few pictures on the way, I'll see if I can get them from her at some point. We listened to most of "An Evening with Kevin Smith" which is fairly amusing.

We got to the house and we went in and visited for a while. It was nice to see [[Mom]] again. I worked on her computer for a while while Jenn made conversation with Mom and Jan. After a while we went out to The Crazy Tomato, a great little Italian place in Evansville. After dinner we grabbed a box of photos out of the garage and headed back to Bloomington. The ride back was nice, and the trip seems a lot less taxing with Jenn along.

When we got back we dug into the photos until I had to go into work.

Here at work we're doing the normal Sunday morning routine.  I've also been listening to Al Frankin's "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them" Audio Book that Eric left for me in Evansville. It's pretty brilliant. (Al Franken)++

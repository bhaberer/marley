# Guild Wars, Fresco Style, and other things...

So I got in on the GuildWars world preview event that was going on this weekend, it was pretty cool, I'll go over what I like and don't like in a separate post. The game is made by a bunch of ex-Blizzard employees who quit Blizzard cause the man was getting them down or something. You can feel that the diablo people are at work a bit... but the GUI guy musta stayed at Blizzard. {nid 1GX}

So I've begun to love the Fresco Style Burritos from Taco Bell. I get the new Bean Burrito, and make sure they take the sauces off, and add the fresco salsa. It's good. I have to be very specific when I ask for it or they'll put red sauce on it or something. TacoBell++ (for once). {nid 1GY}

I'm glad to finally have my [http://www.neurosaudio.com Neuros] back. I've been listening to a lot of electronic again recently and it's too big of a collection for me to fit it on my tiny work hard drive, so I have to use my Neuros. Meh. {nid 1GZ}

I'm thinking I want to start writing for http://joystick101.org but I don't know if it's dead forever or even if it's an option to start writing for them again after I quit for god knows how long. I used to write little stuff for them here and there, but I have kind of had this desire in the back of my head to get back on the path towards maybe getting into the gaming industry, and this would be a good step in that direction, and the guys that ran the site were really cool.  {nid 1H0}

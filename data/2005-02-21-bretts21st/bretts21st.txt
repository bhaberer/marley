# Brett's Birthday, and other things.

Looks like [http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20050221/ap_on_re_us/obit_thompson Hunter S. Thompson has killed himself] which is kind of sad, but not that surprising, he was a fucked up guy.  {nid 1LX}

Brett's 21st birthday was this weekend, it was a fun time. We (Joe, Anami, Paul, Troy, Jenn and I) took him out on the town and got him fairly inebriated. We started at Bears for dinner, then headed to the Jungle Room for pool, and then to Nicks for darts. I had to take Jenn home after Nicks cause it was getting a bit late for her.  {nid 1LY}

After Nicks the guys all headed for the Irish Lion, where Brett evidently got flirted with by the server and got quite a few drinks, including his first [http://www.drinkalizer.com/drinks/blow-job.php blow job] bought for him by the server which was cool. He chickened out and used his hands to do the shot tho... boo! :) We left with Brett a little unsteady on his feet with Uncle E's as our next destination.  {nid 1LZ}

At uncle E's we had a few drinks and the bar tender gave Brett a flaming lemon drop. Basically she set the bar on fire and had Brett blow out the flames, shoot the shot, and then eat a lemon slice ultra quick, he seemed to like it. It looked cool as hell. After a bunch of water and mild protests from Brett about his ability to comprehend reality, and/or walk, we headed to Bullwinkle's for the end of the evening.  {nid 1M0}

Unfortunately Brett got hit by an alcohol wave (Read: his drinking caught up with him and kicked his ass), and started panicking a bit. So we tried to get him to dance for a while, but finally relented and headed out.  {nid 1M1}

I had to split at that time tho, it was a good night and I hope Brett had fun! (he assured me he was at one point before the freaking out... so here's hoping) {nid 1M2}

Not much else to report...  {nid 1M3}

# I still can't believe she said yes.:)

So Saturday was [[Jenn]] and my one year anniversary. The day before I had shown up at her work with a bouquet of roses (really neat looking ones too) and lunch from Asuka (a special maki roll she loves and an order of Edamame) and we had a nice lunch in her office, she was so happy that I actually did something sweet... Pavlovian conditioning is the best :) Just kidding... mostly. {nid 1M9}

For Saturday we had a nice stress free day planned out. We slept in decently late, something that Jenn never gets to do these days, and got moving around 12:00 or so... I discovered a gift from Jenn, a pocket watch with the inscription "For Good Times" written inside, which was awesome. I love it.  {nid 1MA}

We decided to go see a movie, since we had two free tickets.. and went and saw [http://www.mgm.com/becool/ Be Cool] which I enjoyed, it wasn't the best movie ever but it was fairly amusing.  {nid 1MB}

We headed out to Oliver to get a bottle of wine to save for our next anniversary, we sampled several wines and settled on their Chardonel. We also got a bottle of the Bean-blossom Cider for some night soon. We headed back to Bloomington for dinner.  {nid 1MC}

We had intended to have dinner at Puccini's LA Dolce Vita (overpriced Italian), but we opted instead for Shanti (Slow Indian). The meal was very nice and after we finished our Naan we headed back to the apartment to have a nice night together.  {nid 1MD}

I played a bit of WoW, and Jenn studied for a bit, but we eventually gave up on that and hunkered down to watch a few episodes of Simpsons. After a couple Jenn complained that she didn't have her card from me yet, and so I sheepishly told her that I had yet to finish writing it for her. She rolled those eyes at me and wandered off to let me finish.  {nid 1ME}

As soon as she left I lit about 10 candles in the room and took a deep breath... I slide the card that I had already written under the door, and retreated to my room. The card told her that I had something to ask her in the other room.  {nid 1MF}

She walked into the room clad in her PJ's and I got down on one knee and asked her if she would do me the honor of marrying me.... and she said yes! :) {nid 1MG}

It still hasn't sunk in yet, but... I'm like engaged now. :) {nid 1MH}

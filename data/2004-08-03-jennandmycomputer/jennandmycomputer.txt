# Jenn's nightmarish plane trip and other fun stuff.

So I promised the story of Jenn's plane trip.

So I promised the story of Jenn's plane trip. Jenn's plane was supposed to be arriving in Indy around 7:00pm on Wednesday... however due to a freakish storm it got delayed, and delayed, and delayed. This was made a lot more fun because of the fact that Jenn's cell phone charger was in here unavailable checked baggage. So Jenn's plane gets canceled and I don't hear from her for a few hours... almost to the point of freaking out, I get a call from a weary Jenn saying she's at a Holiday Inn in North Dallas, and that the storm has broken the computer systems at the hotel and so i need to call her in a half of an hour. So I look to find the number... not thinking that there would be TWENTY FIVE freaking Holiday Inns in the Dallas/Fort Worth Area.

I enlisted Jenn's mother, who lives in Texas to help in finding the right hotel. We found her finally and made sure she was ok; after that she went to bed to wake up in the morning to hopefully get on a 7:00am plane... leaving a mere ~14hours after she was supposed to!

So that's that story. Anyway, Jenn's mother is in town, so that's been fun. Jenn's mom is cool. :)

I've been saving money in part to just be saving money but also in part to be able to buy a new trek bike. I have been looking at the [http://www.trekbikes.com/bikes/2004/mountain/4500.jsp#largerview 4500] but they seem to have run out of them for the year or something. SO I'm just waiting for the 2005 models. But since they won't be out for a few weeks/months yet I'm thinking about one of the other things I've been saving up for. My poor belabored computer.

So my current computer, [[Shiva]], is running a AMD XP 1700+. A processor I won at [http://sauron.ucs.indiana.edu/eventpics/lanwar3/imagepages/image22.htm The IU Lanwar III]. This is a processor that has served me well, but since even my girlfriend has a faster CPU than me, it's time to upgrade. :) I've been looking at a [http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=13-130-457&depa=0 MSI K8N Neo Platinum] Motherboard (nForce3, w00t) and an AMD 64 3000+. This would set my bike fund back a little but by the looks of Trek's site they aren't going to be showcasing the new 2005 bikes anytime soon. I'm going to think about it a little more, but I'm getting tired of cursing at my computer randomly. :)

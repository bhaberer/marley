# Nice Day.

Today was a nice day off. After [[Jenn]] went to work I ran and got some paperwork and stuff for her from the condo people. I stopped by work to take care of a few things, and then went and hung out with Jenn in her office for a while.

On the way home I picked up some lunch from Quiznos and came home and took a short nap.

I think tonight we're either going to hit HoosierHeights or just go see some movie. Good Times.

Tomorrow we have some condo inspection we're doing, and then we are going to head down to Evansville for a few hours. And probably come back around dinnertime.

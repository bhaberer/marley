# Math is fun!

I went with Jenn to see a math  lecture at the FineArts building last night... it was pretty cool. Jenn was running a little late so we were some of the astonishingly large crowd that had to sit on the floor.

I went with Jenn to see a math  lecture at the FineArts building last night... it was pretty cool. Jenn was running a little late so we were some of the astonishingly large crowd that had to sit on the floor. 

The lecture was pretty interesting, it was about Consequential Probability.

The main example he gave was to think about how many people you think it would take to have a group with equal odds that two people would have the same birthday. The answer was actually 23... he gave the formula

::''n = 1.2 * sqrt(c)'' 

Where n is the number of people you would need for equal odds, and c is the number of categories. so 1.2 sqrt(365) = 22.9. He also told a lot of stories about debunking ESP people and about card tricks and stuff... it was all fascinating. 

Thanks to Jenn for the invite, I think I may goto his second speech that is supposed to be tomorrow.

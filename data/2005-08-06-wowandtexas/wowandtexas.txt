# Not dead, I promise.

So evidently I have not journaled in like 60 days. Oops. {nid 1XE}

I kind of fell off the Earth there for a lot of people, sorry about that, I wasn't exactly feeling chipper about life in general. I'm such a bad blogger, I stop journalling when I get depressed and apathetic... I should be like posting bad poetry about breathing deep the darkness that envelopes my soul... ah well, guess I'll never be a cool blogger-type. {nid 1XF}

[[Jenn]] and I have our [http://weirdo513.org/gallery/album81 engagement photos] back. They are pretty cool ^_^ I really like Jeremy, he's a cool photographer. I think we're going to get some more done since the day we went to the Cascades the humidity was at like 98%, it was horrid, and it left a lot of the shots too foggy to use, which sucks. But he does lots of cool things like some dumb-asses gratified the waterfall, and he removed the ugliness from the waterfall pictures.  {nid 1XG}

Work is still pretty craptacular, but I've had a long talk with my boss and hopefully something good will happen soon. I've also had an offer from elsewhere in UITS, but I don't know when that's actually going to happen.  {nid 1XH}

World of Warcraft is continually a challenge in many aspects. A guild of like 200 is like having 200 opinionated children. :) But we get through the drama and the arguments and work together as a team. We are currently pooling resources and time to beat the last challenge in "The Molten Core" which is a [http://wowguild.net/ohnoesrag.jpg 50 foot tall Fire God].  He's a bit of a pain in the ass, we'll figure his bullshit tactics out soon enough and have him down.  {nid 1XI}

I went with [[Jenn]] to Katy, TX for a few days a week or two ago. It was nice to get away and read for a few days. I Burned through the first two books of the [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743471199/qid=1123367958/sr=8-3/ref=pd_bbs_3/102-4551379-4440164?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 War of the Ancients] books (I just finished the third last night, a very good little series imho) and the New Harry Potter, which I also very much enjoyed, even if it left me a bit shocked. I also started reading "When will Jesus bring the pork Chops" by George Carlin and some book about how Liberals need to stop acting like a bunch of wusses. Both seem good so far.  {nid 1XJ}

I'm also planning on going to Turkey Run State Park the last week in August. Jenn and I are getting a room for a few days and we're going to go horseback riding and hiking and such. It will be incredible. :) {nid 1XK}

That's about it for now I guess. Jenn wants me to stop blathering on this and go to the gym with her... *rolls eyes* Adios.  {nid 1XL}

# Sushi Ravings

So about a year or two ago.. maybe three? I don't really remember... I tried Sushi for the first time. Jess (former SO of Tim) elected for us to go out for sushi, and I was not impressed.

So about a year or two ago.. maybe three? I don't really remember... I tried Sushi for the first time. Jess (former SO of Tim) elected for us to go out for sushi, and I was not impressed. It wasn't a bad experience, but it seemed very non interesting and expensive. I tried some things and was just overall unimpressed with sushi as a whole.

Over the past couple years I've had a few rolls here and there, but I've maintained my "Sushi is fine and good but I'm not a huge fan" stance. I had lots of fun making Makizushi with mostly veggies... I think we had that imitation crab stuff as well. Good times. And, I also enjoyed some takeout sushi from the sushi shelf in Kroger / Marsh. (Although I wouldn't go there for much) 

But, about 6 months ago, we went to Sushi Bar with some of Jenn's friends for a birthday bash. I ordered a Shrimp Tempura roll, and I was amazed. It wasn't boring and horribly textured and such. After that, I started getting tempura rolls at Asuka when we went, but I wasn't that into it yet...

However, one night I had the good fortune of driving by Sushi Bar on my way to work and I noticed that they were open late, so I stopped in and got an order of sushi. And, I was hooked.

It became my Saturday night ritual to stop in at Sushi bar and pick up a few rolls, and I was happy with my little ritual, I started stopping in for lunch, and I was enjoying eating a little healthier (I'm not kidding myself, it's not ultra-healthy but it's certainly better than fast food) part of my diet.

But I felt I was missing out on something, because people are sushi freak shows, and I just wasn't feeling on it... so I spent some time searching around and I found a few pages that were fairly educational. The [Sushi Eating HOWTO](http://eugeneciurana.com/musings/sushi-eating-HOWTO.html) is a Sushi guide written by Eugene Ciurana. If you have any interest in doing things the "Correct, Japanese Way" this guide is '''Highly Recommended'''. Also, by following some of the stuff in this guide I was able to increase my enjoyment of eating sushi by a large amount. It has a lot of pointers on how to spot bad sushi bars, how to order food, how to get better service, etc.

One quote that I liked was "A good Japanese restaurant is ''most often not'' a good sushi place.  A good sushi place is ''usually'' a good Japanese restaurant." Once you've read that, another good resource is, of course, [The Sushi Wikipedia Entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi). That's a no brainer.

I've taken to going to Sushi Bar 2-4 times a week on average. I tend to sit at the bar, and order from the Itamae when I can. I've stopped getting only Maki Rolls and moved into trying (albeit with some trepidation) some Nigiri and Sashimi. I'm happy that I gave Sushi a real shot, as I'm really enjoying it...

Also, another item of surprise: I've only ever had Sake hot. Like in those little ceramic bottles heated up. But a few weeks ago I was having a very nice dinner at Sushi bar and decided that the recent power outage and stress warranted my springing for a nice glass of Sake. I selected a glass of [Momokawa Silver](http://momokawa.com/cgi-local/SoftCart.exe/sake/silver.html?L+scstore+nddd2792ffbc36bc+1146141958) and it was incredible.

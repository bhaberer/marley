Joining the Gallup Panel.

So I got a standard Gallup poll call last night, I've never gotten one from the actual Gallup people before, so I took 3 minutes to respond to a few questions, mostly about bush and iraq. At the end of the call the guy (who was extremely nice about the entire call to the point of offering to leave me alone if I had more important stuff to do.) Asked if I wanted to join the Gallup Panel. 

I told him to let me think about it and he's gonna call me back in a week. I can't decide if it's a good idea or not. On the one hand it's a chance to actually give my stupid opinions on a weekly basis to someone who will actually give a damn. But it's may also include market research, which is less attractive to be sure. 

So I'm still pretty undecided, Jenn thinks it's a dumb idea, but I remain on the fence. What do people think?

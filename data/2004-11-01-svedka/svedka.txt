# Svedka++ 

So a few weeks ago I was out with [[Jenn]] getting some Martini fixins for the first presidential debate party. We got some Skyy Vodka, but the Big Red guy reccomended another vodka called Svedka. I passed and got Skyy instead. {nid 1H1}

For Joe's birthday we got more alcohol and Paul and I got some Svedka to donate to the Steve Simms memorial traveling bar, and it ended up being really outstanding. So I went to Big Red a little while ago to pick up another bottle for myself, and found out that the Svedka has proved so popular (selling for half the price of Absolute and a third of Grey Goose), and [http://www.svedka.com/pdf/bestbuy.pdf higly rated (check this out)] that Big Red is out, all over the city. So no Svedka for me for until the weekend or so... ah well :) {nid 1H2}

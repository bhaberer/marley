# Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to what we should have released last year.

Well I've gotten an invite for the new expansion to SWG that adds on Space Combat.

Well I've gotten an invite for the new expansion to SWG that adds on Space Combat. I'm poking at it now, but they aren't letting us turbo up so it may be a few hours before I manage to get into space. But, we'll see how it goes, I've yet to be impressed tho.

Whoo, it just crashed when I tried to jump into space... wonderful.

Not a lot more to report, I'll post more when I have something interesting to say :P

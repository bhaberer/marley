# What a week!

Well I'm alive, sorry I've been so insanely crazy busy this week with lots of things.

Well I'm alive, sorry I've been so insanely crazy busy this week with lots of things.

Work this week has been insane, I'll post on that in a bit tho.

I had a fantastic week with [[Jenn]]. It's been wonderful and I'm not going to write out a blow-by-blow, but here are some highlights :)

* Making Miso Soup and Steamed Asparagus for dinner. It was very yummy I felt all cool making dinner for [[Jenn]] :)
* Coloring Easter Eggs! {nid P0}
* Assembling Jenn's Computer, and it not working! Bah! I think it may be the Mother Board since the computer just refuses to POST.
* Going over to JoeandAnami's for dinner on Wednesday they made LentilsandGreens, Hummus, and Tabula (spelling?). It was very yummy and a very nice time. [[Jenn]] got to meet TangoDog, and chat with JoeandAnami a little. It was GoodTimes. But by that time we were starting to feel the effects of:
* Both [[Jenn]] and I getting sick and feeling lousy together for the past few days.
* [[Jenn]]'s new car being dumb all week, but we took it to the shop and it seems to be doing better.
* [[Jenn]] sold her old car and found a condo! Yay :)  

Today was very nice despite the fact that we are both feeling rather pathetic.  I took [[Jenn]] into work in the morning since her Toyota was in the shop. I went home and had a horrid time with every computer I touched.

First, I walked in the door and noticed that [[Ark]]'s 80gb drive was dead. So there goes my collections of cartoons again. Arg. The drive has a good warranty thankfully. Then I proceeded to troubleshoot Jenn's machine for a while I know the video card, CPU, RAM, disk drives, case and power supply are not to blame so that pretty much leaves the Mother board. I'm trying to get a hold of BoCo who should have an extra I think... :-)

Around then I gave up, and I started cleaning up and went and picked up Jenn from work. We came home and napped and then watched some Simpsons and such. We went to LaughingPlanet for some hearty food and split a classic with spinach. Then we went and got some Gellato, cause Jenn had never had it before. 

Then we went to the Cascades and wandered around. The waterfall is going decently so that was nice, Jenn got some good pictures which I'll try to post in the next day or so.

I think tonight we are going to sit around and be pathetic together and watch Amelie. yay. :)

# Mmmmmm.... Bread sticks

So not a whole lot has been going on, but enough was going on that it was annoying to think about sitting down and writing it all out.

So not a whole lot has been going on, but enough was going on that it was annoying to think about sitting down and writing it all out. I hate that feeling, because it never gets better, there's always more stuff to write about! Bah.

First off, and before I bore everyone to tears, today is Free Bread sticks Day. Head down to PizzaExpress between 4pm-8pm and you'll get a free order of bread sticks evidently, no purchase necessary. PizzaExpress rules.

I watched the debates with [[Jenn]] and we watched the Daily Show afterwords. It was pretty entertaining. I felt that Kerry did well, but not well enough to suit my tastes. I'm still voting for him, because I'm not stupid. I mean seriously... I even got a higher score on the SATs than Bush. (Bush only managed to net a 1206 on his SAT, Kerry had a 1355 [Sub note: I know that their test scores could be 're-centered' but that's the numbers they got, if they want better scores they can retake the test.])  The Daily show hit on all the best parts, and their footage is on-line and available to stream [http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/ on their website]. If you didn't see them it's worth the watch. :)

I finished with [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1880418592/qid=1096981199/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_2_1/102-2395863-5827319 Song of Susannah] and I liked it OK, not my favorite book of the series, but OK. I went to the book store shortly after I finished it and magically [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1880418622/qid=1096981076/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-2395863-5827319?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 The next, and last book] of the series had been released. I've been reading that rather rabidly.

Last weekend [[Jenn]] fell ill, I went over Friday night and spent all Saturday taking care of her. Poor thing, she could barely talk :( She seems to be feeling better now, so that's a plus. Although she has a test today, and she's got more studying to do, I know she'll kick ass though, I don't think she knows how to not do well in school. ;)

I got a [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00009XFX4/102-2395863-5827319?v=glance Smores maker] (not that exact one, but the idea is the same), and that's been fun the one time we've used the thing. It's like a fondue Sterno lite more-or-less, and works well. I'm a fan.

I'm still at work and it's 8:15, so I'm going to end this for now, maybe I'll pick it up later on :)

# Blah-Blah-Blah

Good couple of days. Today was fairly productive at work. I had lunch with my friend Rob who is now the DMCA compliance guy at the university. We went to Lennies, which was yummy. We talked a bit about the mechanics of a game he's beta testing for called [http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/tinydancer.shtml World of Warcraft]. It sounds pretty neat.  Yea I'm a dork.

I got tickets today for [http://www.freeradical.co.nz/content/42/42sciabarra.html The Laramie Project], KarenL started getting a group of people together, so far it's [[Mom]] and JanS, KirstenHaberer, and [[Jenn]] and I.  It looks like it will be fairly interesting. I also noticed [http://www.herbiehancock.com/ Herbie Hancock is coming] soon, I'm looking for people interested in coming with me to his show on the 7th.

Tycho has a nice little bit over at [http://www.penny-arcade.com/news.php3?date=2004-03-24 Penny Arcade] about the new Kevin Smith movie that's coming out as well as [http://www.viewaskew.com/news/mar04/2.html a link to an interview]. I like this quote.

:Apparently Kevin Smith has sold out though, claims the chorus, for producing a film which does not refer to oral sex. The movie may be bad for any number of reasons, I honestly don't know - like many other people I have not seen it. I don't know that I ever need to. However, I'm not sure what selling out has to do with anything. I have a feeling that Kevin Smith pretty much does whatever the fuck Kevin Smith wants to do. Maybe you haven't seen Jay And Silent Fucking Bob Strike Back, where he and his friends just kind of fucked around while the cameras rolled. Oh yeah, he's a part of the fucking machine.

Tycho is quite a writer, and he keeps me reading the site rather than just laughing at the comics.

After work [[Jenn]] and I went climbing again, it was a lot of fun. She climbed the 5.7 that had been giving her grief. I was happy for her. She's learning so quickly... It's so cool. :)

I got [http://www.eagames.com/official/battlefield/vietnam/us/home.jsp Battlefield: Vietnam] and [http://www.unrealtournament.com/ Unreal Tournament: 2004] the other day, and I've been playing them in my small amounts of free time. Both are pretty nice, and highly entertaining.

# Brain Dump

The random updates will consume my creative soul.

I suck at normal updates so I'll spew a bit.

Went up to Indy yesterday, I picked up two 15oz Bodum Pavina glasses (to match the 6 x 8oz ones I have) (Side Note: I knew those were glass, Jenn said they were Lucite and I knew that was wrong, it is borosilicate glass aka pyrex), a few nice cocktail glasses, and some replacement plates for the random nicks and accidents our dishes have gotten since the wedding. We went by a coat place and I picked up a very nice, wool long coat. I have one currently that I've beaten to shreds, I payed a bit more for this one, so I expect it to hold up better.

We had dinner with Tim at an alright Italian place on the north side of Indy and then headed home. It was a nice, if expensive trip.

Still debating on the camera. I'm fairly confident that if I decide to get a camera it will be a Nikon D80. But I keep going back and forth on whether or not it's a good investment or just pointless spending.

Got Super Mario Galaxy, and it is by far the most solid, polished, and well designed 3d platformer I have ever played. Highly recommended!

I'm using plazes now a bit, it's nothing special, but it's interesting.

Holiday Plans
-------------

Thanksgiving will be here in Bloomington, hanging with friends for the holiday.

Christmas will be in Texas (12.21 - 12.27), hanging with Jenn's mother.

Work
----

Socialtext got some Fuding and a new CEO so that.s cool.

We also have a cool little screen cast which lets me explain what we do to other people without as much confusion.

Work is going good, I.m getting more integrated with the people I work with, which is both good and bad, encouraging and sobering. My coworkers both inspire me, and cause longing for a stiff drink. I take the bad with the good.

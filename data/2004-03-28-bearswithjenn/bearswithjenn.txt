# A trip to Bears.

I couldn't sleep very well last night, but that didn't stop me from having to go into work... meh.  it was a blah day until Jenn stopped by and brought me some cookies [!! :) ] we went to lunch at LaughingPlanet with was very nice. We sat outside and chatted in the beautiful weather. How nice.

After work I went home and cleaned a little, and worked on some random computer problems. (The [[Gallery]] is being really slow for some reason) After a while I went over to [[Jenn]]'s place to watch King of the Hill and hang out with her. We then went over to BearsPlace to watch simpsons with TimCarper. When we got there BethM and MatthewOconnor were already there with TimCarper. It was a good day...

Tomorrow we are going to see The Laramie Project. Jenn and I are going with my Mom (SusanThomas), JanS, KarenL and my little sister (KirstenHaberer).  I think Jenn is pretty brave personally.
